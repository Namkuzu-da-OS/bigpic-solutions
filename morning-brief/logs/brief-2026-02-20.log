Morning brief written to `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/morning-brief/2026-02/2026-02-20_Fri.md`.

**Summary of the report:**

- **Event Load: HEAVY** — Triple macro data dump (GDP + Core PCE + Flash PMIs), monthly options expiration, pending Supreme Court tariff ruling, and U.S.-Iran geopolitical risk
- **Bias: Cautious / Neutral-Bearish** — VIX elevated at 20.51, SPY trend bearish, Russell leading weakness, gold pressing new highs at $5,044
- **Key event at 13:30 ET:** GDP (consensus 2.8%) and Core PCE (consensus 0.3%) arrive simultaneously. Stagflation scenario (GDP miss + hot PCE) is the main risk. Full scenario matrix included.
- **Watchlist highlights:** DNN +5.3 z-score on final uranium permit, PANW and ZS both at RSI 29 (deeply oversold Tier 1 cyber names), defense primes overbought (LMT RSI 74, NOC 71). TENB is the only watchlist ticker in the auto-detected movers (+3.02%).
- **Next week is massive:** CEG (Mon), NVDA (Tue), ZS/VST/RKLB/MP (Wed), CRWD/AVGO the following week
- **Thesis catalysts advancing today:** DNN permit (nuclear fuel cycle), LAC $1.6B financing (critical minerals), RIO/Nemaska (lithium), NOC/Embraer KC-390 and BA satellite sensors (defense)
