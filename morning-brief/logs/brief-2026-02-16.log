The Morning Brief has been written to `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/morning-brief/2026-02/2026-02-16_Mon.md`.

**Summary of the report (~2,800 words, HEAVY calibration):**

- **Presidents' Day** — US markets closed. Planning session for a packed week ahead.
- **Futures mildly green** (+0.24% to +0.35%) with VIX pinned at 20.60 in an elevated regime.
- **38 watchlist tickers moved >3% upside** — broadest strength in cybersecurity (Chrome zero-day, BeyondTrust catalysts), quantum computing (Majorana qubit breakthrough), nuclear (War/Energy Dept partnership), and energy storage (ASEAN BESS expansion).
- **Tomorrow's earnings triple-header:** PANW (RSI 33, deeply oversold), LDOS (+6.14% today with momentum), CEG (nuclear sentiment strong).
- **RSI extremes flagged:** ZS (26), ISRG (28), FLNC (32), PANW (33) as oversold Tier 1 candidates; CGNX (89) overbought caution.
- **Key catalysts cross-referenced** from all 9 thesis files — 17 upcoming catalysts mapped with dates through mid-2026.
- **Bias: Neutral-to-cautiously bullish** with a playbook focused on preparing for Tuesday and identifying oversold quality entries.
