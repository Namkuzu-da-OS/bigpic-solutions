The morning brief has been written to `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/morning-brief/2026-02/2026-02-24_Tue.md`.

**Summary of the HEAVY event load brief (~2,700 words):**

- **Pre-Market:** Futures barely positive, VIX elevated at 21.36, crypto in freefall (BTC -5%, ETH -5.2%), gold pulling back, yields flat
- **Big movers:** AMD +9.6% (Meta $100B deal), IBM -13% (worst day in 26 years on AI COBOL threat), BWXT +7.4%, HIMS -5.2%
- **Calendar:** CB Consumer Confidence and Richmond Manufacturing at 15:00 are the data events; six FOMC speakers throughout the day
- **Watchlist highlights:** Cybersecurity in capitulation territory (ZS RSI 19, PANW 25, CRWD 28); NVDA earnings tomorrow sets the tone; CEG reporting today
- **Approaching catalysts:** NVDA Wed, ZS/RKLB/VST/MP Thu, CRWD next week, FOMC+Triple Witch Mar 17-20
- **Bias:** Neutral-to-cautious — AMD deal and HD beat offset by IBM crash, software selloff, crypto weakness, and tariff uncertainty

All done. Here's a summary of what was completed:

**Step 1 — Read:** Parsed the compiled markdown at `2026-02-24_Tue.md` (HEAVY event load — AMD-Meta $100B deal, IBM worst day in 26 years, 6 FOMC speakers, consumer confidence, NVDA earnings tomorrow, crypto plunge).

**Step 2 — HTML Build:** Generated `2026-02-24_Tue.html` matching the BigPic theme with all sections:
- Fixed nav with back-arrow and section anchors
- Hero with HEAVY badge (pulsing red dot)
- Pre-market snapshot grid (14 instruments, color-coded)
- Overnight/Global cards (Asia, Europe, Key Reads)
- Calendar table (12 events, medium-priority highlights for Waller, Consumer Confidence, Richmond Manufacturing)
- Thesis watchlist (CEG earnings today, upcoming NVDA/ZS/RKLB/VST/MP, pre-market movers with AMD +9.6% and IBM -13%, RSI extremes, key levels, sector snapshot)
- Approaching catalysts with priority color-coding
- Scenario analysis (Bull 20% / Base 45% / Bear 35%) with tabbed layout
- Playbook with bias, watch-for, and risk bullets plus sector impact pills
- Collapsible sources section
- Footer with compilation note

**Step 3 — Publish:** Added Tuesday's entry at the top of the February 2026 group in `index.html`, moved the "Latest" badge from Monday's entry to the new one, then committed and pushed (`e0a080b`).
