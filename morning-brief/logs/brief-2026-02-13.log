**Key highlights of the report (~2,800 words, HEAVY depth):**

- **CPI is the main event** — consensus 2.5% y/y, early indications suggest 2.4% (below expectations). Full scenario analysis included.
- **ANET +8.33%** — the biggest Tier 1 watchlist move, validating the 800G networking cycle and AI infrastructure capex thesis after yesterday's earnings beat
- **LYSCF +3.23%** — Tier 1 critical minerals mover, Lynas advancing on rare earth demand
- **CCJ earnings before open** — Tier 1 nuclear, the uranium supply deficit bellwether
- **Gold breaks $5,000** for the first time, signaling safe-haven demand
- **Asia risk-off** (Nikkei -1.2%, Hang Seng -1.7%) reversing yesterday's semiconductor euphoria
- **Deeply oversold watchlist names flagged:** ZS (RSI 24), IONQ (RSI 24), ISRG (RSI 26), CACI (RSI 24), FLNC (RSI 29)
- **Catalyst timeline** cross-referenced across all 9 thesis files, covering upcoming earnings (PANW 2/17, NVDA 2/25, RKLB 2/26), Artemis II (3/6), SpaceX IPO (mid-2026), and the November 2026 U.S.-China trade agreement expiry
