# Markets Research — Monday 2026-02-09

## Event Load Assessment
**HEAVY** — Delayed January nonfarm payrolls (rescheduled to Feb 11 due to government shutdown), January CPI on Feb 13, major earnings wave (McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Cisco, Applied Materials, Palo Alto Networks, Shopify, Airbnb, Arista Networks), Fed closed board meeting today, and lingering crypto crash volatility. The jobs + inflation double-header on Tue/Thu makes this one of the most data-dense weeks of Q1.

## Overnight Futures
| Index | Ticker | Level | Change | % Change |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| S&P 500 | ES | 6,939.50 | -13.25 | -0.19% |
| Nasdaq 100 | NQ | 25,075.00 | -88.25 | -0.35% |
| Dow Jones | YM | 50,146.00 | -59.00 | -0.12% |
| Russell 2000 | RTY | 2,673.60 | -4.30 | -0.16% |

Futures are modestly lower across the board, with Nasdaq leading to the downside on continued tech rotation. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday's 1,200-point rebound (+2.47%), and futures are consolidating those gains. Friday's S&P close: 6,932.30 (+1.97%); Nasdaq Composite close: 23,031.21 (+2.18%).

**Weekly context (week ending Feb 6):** S&P 500 -0.1%, Nasdaq -1.8%, Dow +2.5%. Massive rotation out of megacap tech into cyclicals/value continued.

## Asia Session Recap
| Index | Level | Change | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Nikkei 225 | ~54,250 | +0.8% est. | Recovered from tech rout; closed at 54,253.68 on Friday |
| Hang Seng | ~22,800 | -1.1% | Under pressure in final hour Friday; China stimulus hopes fading |
| Shanghai Composite | ~3,280 | Mixed | Lunar New Year holiday period affecting volumes |
| ASX 200 | ~8,650 | Flat | Mining stocks supported, tech dragged |
| KOSPI | 5,163.57 | -3.86% (Thu) | Semiconductor selloff — Samsung -5.8%, SK Hynix -6.44% |

Note: Monday Asia session data still developing at time of writing. Friday's session saw the KOSPI plunge nearly 4% on the global tech rout, while the Nikkei reversed losses to close higher. Hong Kong was the underperformer with the Hang Seng sliding in late trading.

## Europe Session Recap
| Index | Level | Change | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Euro Stoxx 50 | 6,027 | +0.47% | Gaining on Monday open |
| STOXX 600 | ~617 | +0.9% (Fri) | Hit record levels earlier in week |
| FTSE 100 | ~10,050 | Steady | Crossed 10,000 milestone in Jan; energy names supporting |
| DAX | ~23,200 | +0.5% est. | Defense/industrial strength |
| CAC 40 | ~8,150 | +0.4% est. | Luxury names recovering |

European markets opened positively Monday, with the Euro Stoxx 50 up nearly half a percent. Defense stocks continue to benefit from NATO 3.5% GDP spending target trajectory and Golden Dome tailwinds. The EU suspended retaliatory tariffs for six months following the softened US trade position.

## Pre-Market Movers

**Gainers:**
- **Snap (SNAP)** +6% — Q4 earnings exceeded analyst expectations
- **Crypto-adjacent names** rebounding — Bitcoin recovering from weekend crash below $66K

**Losers:**
- **Amazon (AMZN)** -9.3% (carryover) — Flagged ~$200B capex for 2026, well above expectations
- **Alphabet (GOOG)** — Under pressure following volatile extended-hours after earnings
- **Stellantis (STLA)** — Plunged after EV strategy scaling charges
- **Semiconductor names** — Carryover from KOSPI tech rout (Samsung/SK Hynix selloff)

**Key theme:** Massive rotation from megacap tech into value/cyclicals continues. The Dow's surge above 50,000 (+1,200 pts Friday) while the Nasdaq fell 1.8% on the week tells the story.

## Rates & Fixed Income
| Maturity | Yield (Feb 6 close) | Direction |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| 2-Year | 3.50% | Steady — pricing in 2 more Fed cuts in 2026 |
| 10-Year | 4.22% | Rose 4 bps Friday; consolidating below 4.25% |
| 30-Year | 4.85% | Elevated; long-end reflecting fiscal concerns |
| 2s10s Spread | +72 bps | Positive — curve normalized, steepening |

The yield curve remains positively sloped with the 2s10s spread at +72 bps. The 10-year is the key level to watch — it has been range-bound between 4.15%-4.30% since late January. The delayed jobs report (now Feb 11) and CPI (Feb 13) will be the next directional catalysts for rates. The Fed's closed board meeting today is a non-event for markets.

## Currency
| Pair | Level | Direction |
|------|-------|-----------|
| DXY | 97.52 | -0.11% — Continuing its downtrend from 108+ peak in Jan 2025 |

The US Dollar Index fell to 97.52, extending its secular decline. The dollar has weakened significantly from its 108+ highs of early 2025. The US-India trade deal (tariffs cut to 18% from 50%) and EU tariff suspension contributed to improved global trade sentiment, which is dollar-negative. Key support at 96.50; resistance at 99.00.

## Commodities
| Commodity | Level | Change | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| WTI Crude | $63.00/bbl | -0.5% est. | Extending decline; Iran diplomatic talks easing geopolitical premium |
| Brent Crude | $67.40/bbl | -0.6% | Fell below $68 as Iran tensions de-escalate |
| Gold (Spot) | $5,023.55/oz | +1.27% | Rebounding toward $5,000+ after Jan ATH near $5,608; safe haven demand |
| Silver | ~$118/oz | Volatile | Surged with gold but highly volatile week-to-week |

Gold continues its extraordinary 2026 rally, up 72% YoY and trading above $5,000/oz after touching an all-time high near $5,608 in January. Oil is under pressure as US-Iran diplomatic talks reduce the geopolitical premium, with WTI holding above the $62 support level.

## Crypto
| Asset | Price | 24h Change | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | $65,411 | -7.1% | Crashed below $66K; was below $90K since early Jan |
| Ethereum (ETH) | $1,916 | -8.4% | Broke below critical $2,000 level |

The crypto market is in a significant downturn. Bitcoin plunged 7%+ over the weekend, falling to ~$65,400 and extending its decline from the $108K peak in late 2025. Ethereum broke below $2,000 for the first time since mid-2024, trading near $1,916. The total crypto market cap erased $410B recently. Key factors: risk-off sentiment, tech rotation, regulatory uncertainty, and liquidation cascading through leveraged positions. Bitcoin's market dominance at 57.14% shows a flight to relative safety within crypto.

## Economic Calendar
| Time (ET) | Release | Consensus | Prior | Significance |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 11:30 AM | Fed Board Closed Meeting | N/A | N/A | Low — routine bi-monthly meeting |
| **Tue Feb 11** | **Nonfarm Payrolls (Jan)** | **+60K** | **+50K (Dec)** | **HIGH — delayed from Feb 6 due to govt shutdown** |
| Tue Feb 11 | Unemployment Rate (Jan) | 4.4% | 4.4% | HIGH |
| Tue Feb 11 | Avg Hourly Earnings (Jan) | +0.3% m/m, 3.6% y/y | +0.3%, 3.8% | MEDIUM |
| Wed Feb 12 | JOLTS (Dec) | ~7.5M est. | TBD | MEDIUM — also delayed from shutdown |
| **Thu Feb 13** | **CPI (Jan)** | **+0.3% m/m, ~2.7% y/y** | **+0.3%, 2.7%** | **HIGH** |
| Thu Feb 13 | Core CPI (Jan) | +0.3% m/m, ~2.6% y/y | +0.2%, 2.6% | HIGH |
| Fri Feb 14 | Retail Sales (Jan) | TBD | TBD | MEDIUM |

**Government shutdown impact:** The partial government shutdown forced the BLS to delay the January jobs report from Feb 6 to Feb 11. The JOLTS report was also postponed. This creates an unusual compressed data calendar with NFP on Tuesday and CPI on Thursday — two of the most market-moving releases in the same week.

## Fed Speakers
| Time | Speaker | Topic/Venue |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 11:30 AM | Fed Board | Closed meeting (routine) |
| TBD | Vice Chair Philip Jefferson | "Supply-Side Factors and Inflation" — Brookings Institution (date TBD this week) |

Light Fed speaker calendar today. The closed board meeting is routine and unlikely to produce market-moving headlines. Vice Chair Jefferson's speech on supply-side inflation factors could be meaningful — watch for any signals on the pace of 2026 rate cuts. Markets currently pricing 2 additional 25bp cuts in 2026.

## Weekend News Digest

**1. Crypto Crash Deepens**
Bitcoin crashed below $66,000 over the weekend, extending its decline from the $108K November 2025 peak. Ethereum broke $2,000. Total crypto market cap shed $410B. Liquidations cascaded through leveraged positions. This is being called a potential "Crypto Winter" transition.

**2. US-India Trade Deal**
President Trump announced a deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% (from 50%) in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers. This improves global trade sentiment and weakens the dollar.

**3. EU Tariff Suspension**
The EU suspended retaliatory tariffs (10-30% on US goods including motorcycles, jeans, meat) for six months following the softened US trade position. This removes a near-term tail risk for European exporters.

**4. Government Shutdown — Jobs Report Delayed**
The partial government shutdown forced the BLS to delay the January nonfarm payrolls report from Feb 6 to Feb 11. The JOLTS report was also postponed. Consensus expects +60K jobs (vs. +50K in Dec).

**5. Amazon Capex Shock**
Amazon flagged ~$200B in 2026 capital expenditures (AI/cloud infrastructure), well above market expectations, sending shares down 9.3% in post-earnings trading. This is the latest signal of hyperscaler AI spending acceleration ($650B combined in 2026) — bullish for AI infrastructure names (NVDA, AVGO, VRT) but raising ROI concerns.

**6. Dow 50,000 Milestone**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday after rallying 1,200+ points (+2.47%), led by value and cyclical stocks in a massive rotation from tech. The S&P 500 gained 1.97% while the Nasdaq underperformed on the week (-1.8%).

**7. S&P 500 Q4 Earnings Strong**
Fourth-quarter earnings season continues with 13% YoY growth for S&P 500 companies. The earnings wave this week includes Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Applied Materials, Arista Networks, and Shopify — key names for the AI infrastructure and cybersecurity themes.

**8. One-Year Anniversary of "Tariff Weekend"**
February 8-9 marks one year since the 2025 "Tariff Weekend" that launched the 25% universal steel/aluminum tariffs and Reciprocal Trade Act framework. Markets have adapted, though trade policy remains the #1 macro variable.
