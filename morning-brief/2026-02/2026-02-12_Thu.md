## Pre-Market Snapshot

| Metric | Level | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 Futures | — | +0.36% |
| Nasdaq 100 Futures | — | +0.29% |
| Dow Futures | +136 pts | +0.29% |
| Russell 2000 Futures | 2,693 | +0.54–0.85% |
| 10Y Treasury | ~4.21% | Higher expected post-CPI |
| 2Y Treasury | ~3.45–3.52% | +6 bps from jobs data |
| DXY | ~96.88 | +0.05%, firming |
| WTI Crude | ~$64–65/bbl | +1% (3rd straight gain) |
| Brent Crude | ~$69.30/bbl | +1% |
| Gold Spot | ~$5,076/oz | Near 2-week high |
| BTC | ~$67,100–68,150 | +0.5% |
| ETH | ~$1,971 | +1.4% |

Futures edged higher as investors digested yesterday's stronger-than-expected January NFP (130K vs. 55K expected, unemployment 4.3%) and positioned ahead of the January CPI print at 8:30 AM ET. Small caps outperforming (+0.54–0.85%) suggests broadening risk appetite. Semiconductor strength from Asia is providing a Nasdaq tailwind.

**CPI Note:** January CPI came in at 2.9% headline / 2.7% core (vs. 2.7%/2.6% prior). Combined with the strong NFP, this cements "higher for longer" and pushes rate-cut expectations toward September or later. Pre-market gains may reverse at the open as this is digested.

## Overnight / Global

### Asia Session

| Index | Close | Change | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Release | Prior | Consensus | Actual |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **8:30 AM** | **CPI (January, YoY)** | 2.7% | ~2.8% | **2.9%** |
| **8:30 AM** | **Core CPI (January, YoY)** | 2.6% | ~2.7% | **2.7%** |
| 8:30 AM | Initial Jobless Claims | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 10:00 AM | Wholesale Inventories (Dec, revised) | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### Fed Speakers

| Speaker | Event | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Vice Chair Bowman | Dallas Fed Global Perspectives | Monetary policy |
| Gov. Waller | Global Interdependence Center, La Jolla | Economic outlook |
| Vice Chair Jefferson | Brookings Institution, DC | Supply-side factors and inflation |

Powell's testimony yesterday struck a "no urgency to cut" tone at 4.25–4.50%. The hot CPI reinforces this posture. Jefferson's speech on supply-side inflation dynamics is particularly relevant given the CPI print.

### CPI Impact Analysis

Hot CPI (2.9%) + strong NFP = higher-for-longer entrenched:
- **Headwinds:** Pre-revenue names (OKLO, SMR, QS, SLDP, IONQ, RGTI), high-multiple tech, crypto
- **Tailwinds/Neutral:** Profitable companies with backlog visibility (NVDA, VRT, ETN, ANET, LMT, RTX), financials, value
- Treasury yields pushed higher, especially front end
- DXY firming → headwind for commodities (FCX, ALB, SQM), EM equities, crypto
- Rate-cut expectations pushed toward September or beyond

## Thesis Watchlist — Pre-Market Activity

### Major Watchlist Movers

| Ticker | Sector/Tier | Move | Catalyst |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|
| **CGNX** | Robotics / Tier 1 | **+23.2%** | Q4 beat: Rev $252M (+10%) vs $239M est., EPS $0.27 vs $0.22. $500M buyback. Industrial automation recovery confirmed. |
| **MU** | AI / Tier 2 | **+~10%** | DRAM pricing shock, HBM demand surge — igniting global semi rally. Validates "cheapest AI semi valuation" thesis. |
| **ALB** | Crit. Minerals & Storage / Tier 1 | **-7.2%** | Mixed Q4: Rev $1.4B (+16%), Energy Storage vol +17%, but net loss $414M on write-downs. No 2026 rev guide. SQM -4% in sympathy. |
| **CSCO** | AI-adjacent (ANET competitor) | **-7% to -8%** | Raised FY26 revenue but margin pressure. Reinforces ANET competitive thesis — Arista at 27.5% DC switching share vs. Cisco's 29.9%. |
| **EQIX** | AI infrastructure | **+8.6%** | Data center demand beat. Confirms hyperscaler capex flowing through supply chain — supports VRT, ETN, CEG, VST. |

### Watchlist Read-Throughs

- **MU +10% ripple effect** across AI stack: NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, ASML, and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH +2.71% prior session). HBM demand validates the $650B hyperscaler capex narrative.
- **CSCO -7% is bullish for ANET** (Tier 1 AI, reporting tonight). Cisco's margin compression while losing DC switching share to Arista reinforces the 800G cycle thesis.
- **EQIX +8.6% confirms data center demand** — supports the power/cooling picks-and-shovels: VRT, ETN, CEG, VST.
- **CGNX +23% validates robotics thesis** — positive read-through for ROK, FANUY, TER (Tier 2), and the $15B→$24B+ machine vision market.
- **ALB -7% is near-term pain, structural thesis intact** — Energy Storage volume +17% validates lithium demand recovery. $20K+/tonne lithium price recovery thesis unchanged. Watch $145 support.

## Today's Playbook

1. **CPI at 8:30 AM is the dominant macro event.** At 2.9% headline / 2.7% core, inflation is re-accelerating. Higher-for-longer is entrenched. Watch for pre-market futures reversal as the print is digested. Rate-sensitive names (IONQ, RGTI, OKLO, SMR, QS, RKLB at current multiples) face the most pressure.

2. **ANET earnings after close are the most important watchlist event.** Revenue at $2.38B+ confirms the 800G cycle and AI infrastructure capex resilience. A miss or soft Q1 guide would be the first crack in the $650B hyperscaler narrative. Position accordingly.

3. **Semiconductor supercycle validation.** MU +10% on DRAM pricing shock has ignited a global rally (Nikkei +2.3%, Kospi +3.07%, SMH +2.71%). Benefits the entire AI stack: NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, ASML, ANET, VRT, ETN.

4. **CGNX +23% is the cleanest Tier 1 technical breakout.** Industrial automation recovery confirmed with a 10% revenue beat and $500M buyback. First support test at $43 gap-fill. Positive read-through for the robotics thesis.

5. **ALB -7%: lithium demand validated, forward visibility lacking.** Energy Storage volume +17% is constructive. $145 is critical support. Thesis structurally intact but near-term uncertainty from write-downs and missing 2026 guidance.

6. **Defense sector quietly outperforming.** LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX all positive on rearmament. These names are insulated from the CPI/rate headwinds with massive backlogs and dividend visibility.

7. **Watch Fed speakers post-CPI.** Vice Chair Jefferson at Brookings on supply-side inflation is the most relevant given today's print. Any shift in rhetoric from "patient" to "concerned" would move markets.

8. **Look-ahead:** PANW earnings Feb 19 | IONQ Feb 25 | RKLB Feb 26 | **NVDA Feb 26** (the big one) | Artemis II Mar 6.
