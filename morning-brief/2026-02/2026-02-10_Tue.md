---

## Today's Playbook

**Bias: Neutral — Positioning Day.** Light calendar means the market drifts. Real catalysts arrive Wednesday (jobs + MCD). Today's primary watchlist focus: LEU after close, Google/Wiz EU verdict, NXE hearing developments.

**Watch For:**
- LEU earnings after close — HALEU production commentary sets tone for nuclear fuel thesis
- Google/Wiz EU clearance — approval validates CNAPP and benefits PANW, CRWD, ZS
- NXE CNSC hearing Day 2 — positive signals bullish for uranium sector (CCJ, URA)
- VRT pre-positioning ahead of tomorrow's report — new ATH = high expectations baked in
- Defense sector strength — LMT, NOC, LHX all up 1.8-2.3%; security supercycle intact
- Gold above $5K — supports metals sentiment broadly (MP, FCX, ALB)

**Risks:**
- Delayed data creates positioning uncertainty — Wednesday's jobs report is the week's true catalyst
- Crypto selloff (BTC $69K) reflects broader risk appetite caution
- VRT at ATH ahead of earnings — any miss triggers sharp reversal
- Dollar weakness (DXY 97) good for commodities/international but signals growth concerns
- NFIB uncertainty surge (91) reflects tariff/policy headwinds on small business
