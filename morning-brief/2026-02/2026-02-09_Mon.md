## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario A: NFP Hot (+80K+), CPI Sticky (≥0.4% m/m)
- 10Y yield breaks above 4.30%, approaches 4.50%
- Tech/growth selloff extends, Nasdaq tests 24,500
- Dollar strengthens, DXY rebounds toward 99
- Fed cut expectations reprice lower (1 cut in 2026)
- **Defense, value, and cash-flow names outperform**

### Scenario B: NFP Soft (+40K or below), CPI Benign (≤0.2% m/m)
- 10Y yield falls toward 4.00%, 2Y tests 3.30%
- Growth/tech rallies — NVDA, AVGO, ANET lead
- Dollar weakens further, DXY tests 96.50
- Fed cut expectations expand (3+ cuts in 2026)
- **AI infrastructure and high-beta names outperform**

### Scenario C: Mixed Data (NFP in-line ~60K, CPI at consensus 0.3%)
- Range-bound week, 10Y stays 4.15%-4.25%
- Rotation from tech to value pauses
- Earnings become the primary driver (ANET, CSCO, AMAT)
- **Stock-specific catalysts dominate over macro**

## Today's Playbook

### Bias: Cautiously Defensive
Markets consolidating after Friday's strong rally. Pre-positioning for the NFP/CPI double-header dominates. Expect range-bound action Monday with light economic data.

### Watch For
- **NXE CNSC hearing developments** — live catalyst starting today, 99% volume surge Friday signals heavy positioning
- **Google/Wiz EU decision (tomorrow)** — clear = cybersecurity sector catalyst (CRWD, PANW)
- **Crypto stabilization** — BTC at $65K is a key level; failure to hold could cascade to risk assets
- **Defense sector momentum** — LMT, RTX, NOC near ATH; "Security Supercycle" narrative intact
- **ANET pre-earnings positioning** — Thursday's report is the marquee watchlist event this week
- **Lithium watch** — ALB, SQM weak on China spot; recovery thesis faces near-term headwinds

### Risks
- Compressed data calendar (NFP Tue + CPI Thu) creates binary event risk both directions
- Crypto crash could spill into broader risk-off if BTC breaks $60K
- Amazon capex shock (-9.3%) may weigh on mega-cap tech sentiment
- Government shutdown data delays create uncertainty around revisions
- Tech-to-value rotation could accelerate if rates rise on hot data
