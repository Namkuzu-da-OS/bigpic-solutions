| Ethereum | $1,966 | -1.21% | coingecko |

Large caps nearly flat ahead of CPI, while Russell 2000 futures outperform at +0.33% — suggesting risk appetite is rotating toward small caps. **Gold cresting $5,000 for the first time** reflects persistent safe-haven demand and geopolitical hedging. Yields are drifting lower (10Y at 4.089%, down 0.37%), which could signal bond markets are positioning for a benign CPI print. Crypto soft with BTC -1.39% as the "broken rally" narrative below $85K persists. VIX at 20.77 remains elevated but edging down.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 56,942 | **-1.21%** | schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,567 | **-1.72%** | schwab |
| Kospi | 5,507 | -0.12% | stooq |

| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 67.69 | Flat | schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 28.94 | -0.55% | schwab |

### Asia Session
Risk-off overnight in Asia. **Nikkei fell -1.21%** and **Hang Seng dropped -1.72%**, reversing some of yesterday's semiconductor-driven euphoria. The sell-off appears driven by AI/software fear contagion from US pre-market (PINS -22%, broad software weakness per Citi) and pre-CPI caution. Kospi held relatively flat at -0.12%.

### Europe Session
Europe is cautious but holding ground. The DAX is essentially flat, STOXX 50 unchanged. The FTSE and CAC are modestly negative. Markets are in a holding pattern ahead of the US CPI release at 8:30 AM ET.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 00:00 | FOMC Member Logan Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |
| 00:05 | FOMC Member Miran Speaks | Low | — | — | Pending |
| **8:30 AM** | **Core CPI m/m** | **HIGH** | **0.3%** | **0.2%** | **Pending** |
| **8:30 AM** | **CPI m/m** | **HIGH** | **0.3%** | **0.3%** | **Pending** |
| **8:30 AM** | **CPI y/y** | **HIGH** | **2.5%** | **2.7%** | **Pending** |
| 10:00 AM | Mortgage Delinquencies | Low | — | 3.99% | Pending |

**CPI is the main event.** Consensus expects headline y/y at 2.5% (down from 2.7%) and core m/m at 0.3% (up from 0.2%). The Opus feed analysis flagged early indications that the actual print may come in cooler at 2.4% — if confirmed, this would be meaningfully below consensus and could reignite rate-cut expectations. A hot print (2.6%+) would pressure rate-sensitive growth names and validate the "higher for longer" narrative.

**Scenario framework:**
- **Cool (≤2.4% y/y):** Risk-on for growth, rate-sensitive tech, small caps, crypto. 10Y yield likely dips below 4.0%. Bullish for RKLB, IONQ, OKLO, SMR, QS and other long-duration names.
- **In-line (2.5%):** Muted reaction. Market already positioned. VIX drifts lower.
- **Hot (≥2.6%):** Risk-off. Yield spike, growth-to-value rotation, VIX push above 22. Negative for AI/software names already under pressure.

## Pre-Market Movers

| Symbol | Price | Change | Catalyst |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **ANET** | $146 | **+8.33%** | **Tier 1 AI — Earnings beat.** Jumped on Q4 results; validates 800G cycle and AI infrastructure capex. |
| AMAT | $364 | **+10.88%** | Earnings beat. Semiconductor equipment demand robust. |
| ROKU | $97.07 | +17.05% | Streaming earnings beat; analysts see upside. |
| COIN | $153 | +8.56% | Post-earnings — Q4 miss but Ark Invest buying; mixed signals. |
| **LYSCF** | $11.34 | **+3.23%** | **Tier 1 Critical Minerals** — Lynas advancing on rare earth demand. |
| PINS | $14.39 | **-22.38%** | Tariff impact on ad revenue; earnings collapse. |
| DKNG | $21.30 | -15.34% | Q4 earnings miss; guidance disappoints. |
| WEN | $6.90 | -5.04% | Deteriorating same-store sales; near 13-year low. |

**Watchlist flags:** ANET (Tier 1 AI) and LYSCF (Tier 1 Critical Minerals) are the two watchlist names appearing in today's movers. ANET's +8.33% is a direct validation of the 800G networking cycle and Arista's competitive positioning vs. Cisco (which fell -7% yesterday on margin pressure). LYSCF's +3.23% reflects continued momentum for the only non-Chinese rare earth separator at scale.

**Read-throughs from news-driven movers:**
- **MP Materials** advancing on national security narrative and government-backed cash flow floor — constructive for the critical minerals thesis
- **CSCO** "quietly winning AI buildout" per analyst coverage — but yesterday's margin pressure and Arista's beat reinforce ANET as the DC switching winner
- **Zebra Technologies (ZBR)** Q4 beat signals an AI pivot — tangential robotics/automation read-through

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX & Regime
- **VIX:** 20.77 (elevated regime)
- **SPY Trend:** Neutral
- **Risk Appetite:** Cautious

VIX at 20.77 is elevated but easing slightly (-0.24%). The market is in a "cautious holding pattern" — the VIX above 20 reflects uncertainty around CPI and the AI/software narrative deterioration flagged by Citi's "software horror show" analysis. A cool CPI print could drive VIX below 19 and unlock a relief rally. A hot print pushes toward 22-23.

### Today's Bias: **Neutral with bullish lean, CPI-dependent**

**Rationale:**
- **Bullish factors:** ANET earnings beat validates AI infra demand (+8.33%), AMAT strong (+10.9%), yields drifting lower, gold strength suggesting safety bid rather than panic, Russell 2000 outperformance, early CPI leak at 2.4% (below consensus)
- **Bearish factors:** Asia risk-off (Nikkei -1.2%, HSI -1.7%), AI/software fear narrative (Citi), PINS -22% and DKNG -15% showing earnings vulnerability, crypto weakness, VIX still elevated
- **CPI is the tie-breaker.** Pre-market positioning suggests markets are cautiously optimistic for a benign print.

### Key Levels to Watch
- **S&P 500:** Previous close 6,833. Futures at 6,851 (flat). Support at 6,800; resistance at 6,900.
- **10Y Yield:** 4.089%. A break below 4.0% on cool CPI would be bullish for growth. A move above 4.15% would be hawkish.
- **VIX:** 20.77. Below 19 = risk-on. Above 22 = risk-off.
- **DXY:** 96.86. Stable. Cool CPI could push toward 96.50.

### Risk Factors
1. **CPI surprise to the upside** — the single biggest risk today. Hot inflation data would reset rate expectations and compound the AI/software fear narrative.
2. **AI spending narrative erosion** — Citi's "software horror show" report and OpenAI deploying on Cerebras (first move away from NVIDIA) introduce new competitive dynamics.
3. **Tariff escalation** — $3.5B Customs bond funding shortfall signals ongoing trade friction. PINS -22% directly attributed to tariff impact on earnings.
4. **Fed leadership transition uncertainty** — Bessent urging Warsh hearings for Fed chair despite Powell probe introduces institutional risk.
