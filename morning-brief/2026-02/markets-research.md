# Markets Overview -- Thursday, February 12, 2026

**Depth: HEAVY** -- January CPI release day (2.9% headline, 2.7% core) + global semiconductor rally (MU +10%) + major earnings (Siemens +6.9%, Cisco -7% afterhours) + strong NFP still reverberating

---

## 1. Overnight Futures

| Index | Last | Change |
|-------|------|--------|
| S&P 500 | -- | +0.36% |
| Nasdaq 100 | -- | +0.29% |
| Dow Jones | +136 pts | +0.29% |
| Russell 2000 | 2,711 | +0.85% |

Futures edged higher overnight as investors digested yesterday's stronger-than-expected January nonfarm payrolls report (130,000 vs. 55,000 expected; unemployment rate 4.3% vs. 4.4% prior) and positioned ahead of today's January CPI print. The stronger labor data tempered expectations for near-term Fed rate cuts but reinforced the narrative of a resilient economy. Small caps outperformed in overnight trading (+0.85%), suggesting risk appetite is broadening beyond mega-caps. Semiconductor strength from the Asia session is providing a tailwind for Nasdaq futures despite the cautious macro backdrop.

**Note:** These futures levels are pre-CPI (8:30 AM release). The hot CPI print (2.9% headline) may cause a reversal at the open.

## 2. Asia Session Recap

| Index | Close | Change | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Nikkei 225 (Japan) | 57,650 | **+2.28%** | Extending record-high run |
| Kospi (South Korea) | 5,522.27 | **+3.07%** | Record high on Samsung semi surge |
| Hang Seng (Hong Kong) | 27,032.54 | -0.86% | Property weakness |
| CSI 300 (China) | 4,719.58 | +0.12% | Flat; deflation concerns linger |
| ASX 200 (Australia) | 9,043.50 | +0.32% | Modest gains |
| Taiwan TAIEX | -- | +est. positive | Semiconductor strength |

**The story is semiconductors.** The Nikkei surged 2.3% to 57,650, extending its record-high run fueled by PM Takaichi's mandate and a global semiconductor rally sparked by Micron's (MU -- **WATCHLIST**) DRAM pricing shock. South Korea's Kospi exploded +3.07% to a record 5,522 as Samsung Electronics broke above 170,000 KRW on the semi wave. Hang Seng bucked the trend, losing 0.86% on continued China property sector weakness. The ASX 200 ground out a modest gain of +0.32%.

**Watchlist Flags:** The semiconductor rally directly benefits **NVDA, TSM, AVGO, MU, ASML, AMD** from the AI thesis. Samsung's strength signals HBM demand tailwinds for **MU** specifically. The Nikkei's rally on Takaichi's mandate is also supportive of Japanese defense spending, relevant to the global defense thesis context.

## 3. Europe Session (Early -- as of ~3:30 AM ET)

| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| STOXX 600 | -- | +0.4% |
| DAX (Germany) | -- | Positive |
| FTSE 100 (UK) | -- | Positive |
| CAC 40 (France) | -- | Positive |

The pan-European STOXX 600 opened up 0.4% with most sectors and major bourses in positive territory. A bumper earnings day is driving individual stock moves:

- **Siemens** +6.9% after raising FY2026 EPS outlook to EUR 10.70-11.00 -- industrial strength signal
- **Hermes** +3% on 9.8% Q4 revenue growth -- luxury resilience
- **Deutsche Boerse** +1% on $1.3B ISS STOXX stake acquisition
- L'Oreal, Anheuser-Busch InBev, and British American Tobacco also reporting

European markets are waiting on the US CPI print at 8:30 AM ET, which will shape rate expectations for both the Fed and the ECB. The STOXX 600 has been trading at or near record highs.

## 4. Pre-Market Movers

### Gainers

| Ticker | Move | Catalyst | Watchlist? |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| **MU** (Micron) | **~+10%** | DRAM pricing shock, HBM demand surge -- igniting global semi rally | **AI Tier 2** -- "Best US HBM play, cheapest AI semi valuation" |
| EQIX (Equinix) | +8.64% | Data center demand / earnings beat | AI infrastructure read-through |
| SNDK (Sandisk) | +6.07% | Storage demand strength | -- |

### Losers

| Ticker | Move | Catalyst | Watchlist? |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| U (Unity) | **-25%** | Weak Q1 2026 guidance despite strong Q4 results | -- |
| **CSCO** (Cisco) | **-7% to -8%** | Raised FY26 to $61.2-61.7B but weaker gross margin guidance underwhelmed. Q3 guide $15.4-15.6B beat, but profitability weak. | **ANET competitor** -- DC switching read-through |
| ROL (Rollins) | -12.50% | Earnings miss | -- |
| PAYC (Paycom) | -8.22% | Guidance disappointed | -- |

### Watchlist Implications

- **MU +10% is the biggest watchlist mover.** Micron is Tier 2 in the AI thesis as the "best US-listed HBM play, cheapest valuation in AI semis." The DRAM pricing shock and HBM demand narrative validate the core thesis. This rally ripples across **NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, ASML** and the entire AI infrastructure stack. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 2.71% in the prior session, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed up 2.28%.

- **CSCO -7% is a read-through for ANET** (Arista, AI Tier 1). Cisco's margin pressure while Arista continues to take DC switching share (27.5% vs Cisco's 29.9%) reinforces the ANET bull case. The 800G cycle is just beginning and Arista is the primary beneficiary.

- **EQIX +8.6% signals continued data center demand strength**, supporting the power/cooling picks-and-shovels plays: **VRT, ETN, CEG, VST**. This confirms that hyperscaler capex is flowing through the supply chain.

## 5. Economic Calendar -- Thursday, February 12, 2026

| Time (ET) | Release | Prior | Consensus | Actual |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **8:30 AM** | **CPI (January, YoY)** | 2.7% | ~2.8% | **2.9%** |
| **8:30 AM** | **Core CPI (January, YoY)** | 2.6% | ~2.7% | **2.7%** |
| 8:30 AM | Initial Jobless Claims (weekly) | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 10:00 AM | Wholesale Inventories (December, revised) | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### CPI Analysis: THE MAIN EVENT

**January CPI came in hot.** Headline CPI accelerated to 2.9% YoY from 2.7% in December, driven by energy and food increases. Core CPI ticked up to 2.7% from 2.6%. This is a problem for rate-cut expectations.

Combined with yesterday's strong NFP (130K vs. 55K expected, unemployment 4.3%), the data paints a picture of a resilient economy with sticky inflation -- exactly the scenario that keeps the Fed on hold or potentially extends the pause deeper into 2026.

**Market Implications of the CPI Print:**
- Push Treasury yields higher, especially at the front end (bearish for rate-sensitive sectors)
- Support the dollar (DXY likely to firm above 97)
- Compress equity multiples for long-duration growth stocks
- Rate-cut expectations pushed further out -- possibly no cut until September or later
- Potentially weigh on pre-market futures rally as traders digest the 8:30 AM print
- Benefit financials and value over growth

**For the watchlist:** Higher-for-longer is a headwind for pre-revenue names (OKLO, SMR, QS, SLDP, IONQ, RGTI) but neutral-to-positive for profitable infrastructure companies with backlog visibility (NVDA, VRT, ETN, ANET, LMT, RTX).

---

## 6. Fed Speakers -- Thursday, February 12, 2026

| Speaker | Event | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Vice Chair Michelle Bowman | Dallas Fed Global Perspectives | Monetary policy |
| Gov. Christopher Waller | Global Interdependence Center, La Jolla | Economic outlook |
| Vice Chair Philip Jefferson | Brookings Institution, Washington DC | Supply-side factors and inflation |

**Context:** Powell's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony yesterday struck a "no urgency to cut" tone, with the funds rate at 4.25-4.50%. The hot CPI print reinforces this posture. Any post-CPI commentary from Fed officials today will be closely watched for signals on whether the data changes the calculus. Markets are likely repricing rate-cut expectations lower -- the next cut may now be pushed from July to September.

Vice Chair Jefferson's speech on "supply-side factors and inflation" at Brookings is particularly relevant given today's CPI print, as it may address whether the recent uptick is demand-driven or supply-constrained.

---

## 7. Treasury Yields

| Maturity | Yield (pre-CPI) | Direction |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2-Year | ~3.45-3.52% | Higher post-CPI expected |
| 5-Year | ~3.90% (est.) | Higher |
| 10-Year | ~4.21% | Was declining; CPI reversal likely |
| 30-Year | ~4.55-4.81% (est.) | Modestly higher |

The 10-year yield had dipped below 4.2% early this week, falling for two consecutive sessions. However, the hot January CPI print (2.9% headline, 2.7% core) combined with the strong NFP report is likely to push yields higher today, particularly at the front end (2Y). Yesterday's session already saw the 2Y jump to 3.518% (+6 bps) on the jobs data.

**Yield curve:** The 2s/10s spread sits around +66-76 bps, maintaining its positive slope. Further front-end selling on the CPI print could flatten the curve slightly.

**Watchlist Note:** Higher yields are a headwind for nuclear utility valuations (CEG, VST, TLN, PEG), though the contracted nature of hyperscaler PPAs ($80-120/MWh, 20-year terms) provides significant insulation. Pre-revenue names (OKLO, SMR, QS, SLDP, IONQ) face more pressure from higher rates. Conversely, the profitable defense primes (LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX, GD) are relatively insulated with dividend yields and backlog visibility.

---

## 8. US Dollar Index (DXY)

**DXY: ~96.88** (+0.05% overnight, likely to firm further post-CPI)

The dollar steadied above 97 after heightened volatility from the NFP beat. Year-over-year, the DXY is down 9.72% and has weakened 2.27% over the past month, reflecting the broader 2025-2026 downtrend as the Fed has cut 100 bps from its peak rate.

The hot CPI print should provide further support for the dollar today as rate-cut expectations are pushed out. A stronger dollar is a headwind for:
- **Commodity prices** (gold, oil, copper -- impacts **FCX, ALB, SQM** from the minerals thesis)
- **International revenue** for multinationals
- **Emerging market equities** and crypto

---

## 9. Oil

| Contract | Price | Change |
|----------|-------|--------|
| WTI Crude | ~$64-65/bbl | +1% (3rd consecutive gain) |
| Brent Crude | ~$69.30/bbl | +1% |

Oil rose for a third straight session amid lingering US-Iran tensions despite signs of diplomatic progress. Investors are awaiting OPEC's monthly market outlook and an IEA assessment that has warned supply is set to outpace demand, suggesting a sizable surplus in 2026.

**For the watchlist:** WTI hovering near $64-65 is relatively benign for energy-intensive data center operations -- a modest positive for the AI infrastructure power thesis (**CEG, VST, VRT, ETN**). Low oil prices do not materially affect the nuclear renaissance or defense thesis but reduce urgency around traditional energy investments.

---

## 10. Gold (Spot)

**Gold: ~$5,076/oz** (hovering near 2-week high)

Gold remained firm above $5,060, supported by expectations of a more accommodative Fed following soft December retail sales data earlier in the week. Gold is up ~74% year-over-year and has been one of the best-performing assets globally in the past 12 months.

The hot CPI print may create short-term headwinds as it supports a hawkish Fed stance, but gold's secular bid from central bank buying and geopolitical hedging has been dominant. CME raised margin requirements from 6% to 8% after the January record highs.

**Watchlist Note:** Gold strength benefits **PPTA** (Perpetua Resources -- antimony + gold, Tier 3 critical minerals watchlist). Broader commodity strength is supportive for the critical minerals and uranium theses. **FCX** (copper, Tier 1 minerals) faces offsetting forces from gold strength vs. dollar strength.

---

## 11. Crypto

| Asset | Price | 24h Change |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | ~$67,100-68,150 | +0.5% |
| Ethereum (ETH) | ~$1,971 | +1.4% |

Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize around $67-68K after a sharp drawdown from its October all-time high above $126K (-47%). BTC is down 4.7% over the past 7 days. ETH is testing the $2,000 psychological level without securing a decisive breakout. BlackRock was reported to have sent 2,268 BTC and 45,324 ETH to Coinbase Prime on Feb 9, which may indicate selling pressure or rebalancing.

Crypto remains correlated with risk appetite and rate expectations -- the hot CPI print could weigh on both assets. The stabilization attempt is fragile given the macro headwinds (strong jobs + hot CPI = higher-for-longer rates).

---

## Key Themes for Today

### 1. CPI is the dominant macro event.
At 2.9% headline / 2.7% core, inflation is re-accelerating modestly. Combined with the strong NFP report (130K vs. 55K expected), this cements the Fed's higher-for-longer stance and pushes rate cuts further out -- possibly to September or beyond. Risk assets may give back overnight gains post-8:30 AM.

### 2. Semiconductor supercycle validation.
Micron's DRAM pricing shock has ignited a global semi rally (Nikkei +2.3%, Kospi +3.07%, SMH +2.71%). This directly supports the AI infrastructure thesis and benefits multiple watchlist names: **MU, NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, ASML, ANET, VRT, ETN**.

### 3. Cisco vs. Arista divergence.
CSCO's -7% on margin pressure despite raising revenue guidance reinforces the competitive dynamics in DC networking. Arista (**ANET**, Tier 1 AI watchlist) continues to take share (27.5% vs Cisco's 29.9% in DC switching) and the 800G cycle is just beginning.

### 4. Data center demand unabated.
EQIX +8.6% and the semiconductor rally confirm that hyperscaler capex is flowing. This supports the entire AI infrastructure stack across chips, power, cooling, and networking. The $650B hyperscaler capex forecast for 2026 appears on track.

### 5. Small caps outperforming.
Russell 2000 futures +0.85% vs. S&P +0.36% suggests broadening participation, which is constructive for overall market health but needs confirmation after the CPI print.

### 6. Rate-sensitive sectors face headwinds.
With CPI hot and NFP strong, the higher-for-longer narrative is entrenched. Pre-revenue and high-multiple names face the most pressure: **OKLO, SMR, IONQ, RGTI, QBTS, QS, SLDP, RKLB** (at current valuations). Profitable companies with backlog visibility are better positioned.
