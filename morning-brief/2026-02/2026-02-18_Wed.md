# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Wednesday, February 18

FOMC Meeting Minutes dominate today's calendar alongside a packed slate of economic releases. Durable goods, housing starts, industrial production, and a Bowman speech all hit before the main event at 2:00 PM ET. Meta's massive Nvidia AI expansion deal and Palo Alto Networks' guidance miss are the pre-market narratives. Crude is surging on U.S.-Iran tensions and gold continues its march toward $5,000.

**Color:** Large-cap tech futures are leading (NQ +0.51%) while small-caps lag (RTY -0.03%), reflecting the AI trade reasserting dominance on Meta-NVDA headlines. VIX pulling back under 20 into the FOMC minutes is notable — markets are not positioned for a hawkish surprise. The 2s/10s spread at +65 bps remains comfortably positive. Crude is the standout with a near-3% spike on U.S.-Iran tensions. Gold at $4,972 inches closer to the psychological $5,000 level — Scotiabank says the bullion rally has legs. Bitcoin continues to struggle below $68K; institutional exits (Brevan Howard -30%, Founders Fund dumping ETHZilla) are weighing on sentiment.

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 57,144 | +1.02% | schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,706 | +0.52% | schwab |

| Australia (EWA) | 29.11 | -0.72% | schwab |

**Asia:** Japan led with the Nikkei +1.02%, buoyed by a surge in exports (up 17% in January with China shipments soaring). Hong Kong +0.52% despite Alibaba headwinds. Kospi was the laggard at -0.12%, dragged by NAND/memory chip shortage concerns and a potential PS6 delay from Sony. Australia fell -0.72%.

**Europe:** Broad strength across the board. FTSE 100 hit new highs (+0.99%), aided by cooling UK CPI inflation boosting BoE rate cut odds. DAX +0.77% with Germany's fiscal stimulus and defense spending catch supporting sentiment. STOXX 50 +1.15%. European governments are accelerating digital sovereignty spending, creating a defense/tech demand tailwind.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Consensus | Prior |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1:30 PM | Core Durable Goods Orders m/m | Medium | 0.3% | Pending |
| 1:30 PM | Durable Goods Orders m/m | Medium | -1.8% | Pending |
| 1:30 PM | Building Permits | Low | — | Pending |
| 1:30 PM | Housing Starts | Low | — | Pending |
| 2:15 PM | Capacity Utilization Rate | Low | 76.6% | Pending |
| 2:15 PM | Industrial Production m/m | Low | Pending | 0.4% |
| 6:00 PM | FOMC Member Bowman Speaks | Low | — | — |
| **7:00 PM** | **FOMC Meeting Minutes** | **HIGH** | — | — |
| 9:00 PM | TIC Long-Term Purchases | Low | 128.6B | Pending |
| 9:30 PM | API Weekly Statistical Bulletin | Low | — | — |

All events are pending — no actual values have been released yet.

**Key focus:** The FOMC Minutes at 7:00 PM are the marquee event. Markets will parse for any shift in rate path language, discussion of balance sheet policy, and views on cooling inflation vs. persistent services inflation. The steep expected decline in headline durable goods (-1.8% vs. prior +5.3%) reflects normalization after a strong prior month; the core reading (+0.3% consensus) matters more for capex trends. Mortgage rates sinking to monthly lows (per CNBC) adds housing context. Fed Vice Chair Barr's recent speech on AI's labor market implications signals the Fed is thinking about structural AI-driven economic shifts.

## Pre-Market Movers

| Symbol | Price | Change | Sector | Catalyst |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **CDNS** | $304 | **+7.08%** | Semis | Earnings beat |

## Thesis Watchlist Update

### Earnings Reporting Today

| Symbol | Sector | Time | EPS Est | Status |
|--------|--------|------|---------|--------|
| **SEDG** | Energy Storage (Tier 2) | Before Open | — | Pending — results not yet reported |

SolarEdge has been severely beaten down and trades at $37.26 vs. SMA200 of $29.68 (above) but well below its SMA20 of $24.75 — actually, SEDG at $37.26 is above all moving averages, suggesting a recent recovery. Watch for guidance commentary on U.S. BESS demand and European residential solar trends.

### Notable Tier 1 Moves (>3% or RSI Extremes)

|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| **PANW** | Cybersecurity | $152 | **-6.97%** | 31 | Approaching oversold on guidance miss. Below SMA20 ($172), SMA50 ($182), and SMA200 ($193). Sharpest single-day decline in the watchlist. |
| **CACI** | Cybersecurity | $584 | +3.51% | 30 | Up strong but RSI still deeply oversold at 30 — suggesting a bounce within a downtrend. Below SMA20 ($617) and SMA50 ($591). |

### Approaching Catalysts (from Thesis Files)

| Date | Catalyst | Tickers |

| **Feb 24** | CEG earnings (before open) | CEG |
| **Feb 25** | NVDA earnings (before open) — the big one | NVDA, AI sector-wide |
| **Feb 26** | ZS, VST, RKLB, MP earnings | ZS, VST, RKLB, MP |

**Next week is massive** — NVDA earnings on Tuesday Feb 25, followed by ZS/VST/RKLB/MP on Thursday Feb 26. NVDA is the single most important earnings print for the AI infrastructure thesis; consensus estimates are not yet available but the Meta deal expansion is a strong tailwind.

### Key Technical Levels

**Bullish setups (oversold with thesis support):**
- ZS at $172 (RSI 19, SMA200 $269) — extreme oversold ahead of Feb 26 earnings
- FLNC at $17.88 (RSI 27, SMA200 $13.50) — above long-term support, deeply oversold
- IONQ at $33.59 (RSI 29, SMA200 $47.39) — quantum sector has near-term catalysts (Quantinuum IPO, Infleqtion NYSE listing)
- LDOS at $162 (RSI 28, SMA200 $177) — defense spending tailwind intact

**Caution (overbought):**
- CGNX at $57.07 (RSI 83) — extended 48% above SMA200
- VRT at $247 (RSI 71) — 65% above SMA200, strong but stretched

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime & Trend
- **VIX:** 19.87 (pre-market 19.94, -1.72%)
- **Regime:** Normal — below 20 threshold
- **SPY Trend:** Bearish (per market context)
- **Risk Appetite:** Moderate

VIX is pulling back from recent elevated readings but remains near the 20 level that separates complacent from cautious markets. The decline into FOMC minutes is constructive near-term but could reverse quickly on a hawkish read.

### Today's Bias: CAUTIOUSLY BULLISH

**Rationale:**
1. Tech futures leading on Meta-NVDA AI expansion — the most powerful narrative in markets
2. Cooling UK inflation boosts global rate-cut sentiment
3. VIX declining below 20
4. Broad global market strength (Nikkei +1%, FTSE +1%, DAX +0.8%)
5. Mortgage rates at monthly lows suggest financial conditions easing

**Caveats:**
1. SPY trend remains bearish by the data
2. FOMC minutes at 7 PM could reset sentiment
3. Crude surging on Iran tensions adds geopolitical risk premium
4. Bitcoin weakness and crypto institutional exits signal risk-off in speculative assets
5. PANW guidance miss reminds that earnings quality matters

### Key Levels to Watch
- **S&P 500:** Futures at 6,886 vs. previous close 6,843. A sustained break above would challenge the "bearish trend" designation.
- **Nasdaq 100:** 24,893 — leading the way. AI names driving
- **Russell 2000:** 2,653, essentially flat. Small-cap divergence from large-cap is notable
- **10Y Yield:** 4.052% — stable, not threatening equity multiples
- **Gold:** $4,972 — watch for $5,000 psychological level break
- **WTI:** $64.05 — +2.88% on Iran tensions. Sustained move above $65 could shift inflation narrative

### Risk Factors
1. **FOMC Minutes (7 PM):** Primary risk event. Hawkish language on rate path could unwind today's risk-on tone
2. **U.S.-Iran tensions:** Crude at 3-month highs. Escalation could spike energy costs and reignite inflation fears
3. **PANW contagion:** -7% guidance miss could weigh on broader cybersecurity sentiment (CRWD, ZS, FTNT)
4. **Crypto weakness:** BTC sub-$68K, institutional exits accumulating. Risk of cascading liquidations if $65K breaks
5. **Durable goods data (1:30 PM):** A miss below -1.8% consensus could weigh on industrial/capex sentiment
