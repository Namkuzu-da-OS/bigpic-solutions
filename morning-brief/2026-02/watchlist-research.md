## 1. Pre-Market Activity on Thesis Watchlist Tickers

### Major Macro Context

S&P 500 futures +0.36%, Nasdaq 100 +0.29%, Russell 2000 +0.54% in pre-market. Markets are digesting yesterday's stronger-than-expected January jobs report (NFP +130K vs. +55K expected, unemployment down to 4.3%) while positioning ahead of **tomorrow's January CPI release** (Feb 13, 8:30 AM ET). Treasury yields are elevated as traders push back near-term Fed easing expectations. The macro backdrop is "higher for longer" -- good for earnings-driven names, challenging for rate-sensitive pre-revenue plays.

### Major Watchlist Movers

**CGNX (Cognex) -- Tier 1 Robotics -- UP +23.2% to $53.02**
The biggest watchlist mover this morning. Cognex reported Q4 CY2025 earnings last night with a strong beat:
- Revenue $252.3M vs. $238.9M consensus (+10% YoY), constant-currency +9%
- EPS $0.27 vs. $0.22 consensus (23% beat)
- New $500M share buyback announced
- Q1 2026 guide: EPS $0.22-$0.26
- **Thesis validation:** Confirms the industrial automation cycle recovery thesis. Positive read-through for ROK, FANUY, TER (Tier 2 robotics names), and the broader AI-driven machine vision thesis ($15B market growing to $24B+). Full-year 2025 revenue +9% shows sustained demand.

**ALB (Albemarle) -- Tier 1 Critical Minerals / Energy Storage -- DOWN -7.2% to ~$156**
Reported Q4 CY2025 earnings last night. Mixed results:
- Revenue $1.4B (+16% YoY), Energy Storage volume +17%, Ketjen +13%
- Adjusted EBITDA $269M (+7%), led by Energy Storage (+25%) and Ketjen (+39%)
- Net loss of ($414M) / ($3.87) per share -- driven by tax items and Ketjen-related write-down
- 2026 capex guide: $550-600M (flat vs. 2025)
- Selling controlling stake in Ketjen (expected Q1 close), complicating forward comparisons
- **Thesis impact:** Volume growth (+17% in Energy Storage) validates lithium demand recovery, but the lack of clear 2026 revenue guidance and large write-downs spook investors. Lithium price thesis ($20K+/tonne recovery) remains structurally intact. SQM also down ~4% in sympathy.

**ANET (Arista Networks) -- Tier 1 AI Infrastructure -- REPORTING AFTER CLOSE TODAY**
No specific pre-market move yet, but this is the **most important watchlist event of the day**:
- Consensus: Revenue ~$2.38B (near upper end of $2.3-2.4B guide), EPS ~$0.75
- Guided: Non-GAAP gross margin 62-63%, operating margin 47-48%
- Analysts maintain 90% positive outlook, $164 price target (+27% upside)
- **Key watch:** If revenue hits $2.38B+, confirms AI/cloud datacenter networking spend acceleration and supports entire AI infrastructure tier (NVDA, TSM, AVGO, VRT). If closer to $2.30B, market may interpret as demand normalization. Q1 2026 guidance is the real market mover.

### Tier 2/3 Names Flagged in Broad Pre-Market Screens

- **SQM** (Tier 2, Lithium): Down ~4% pre-market, sympathy with ALB weakness and softening lithium carbonate prices in China.
- **Defense primes broadly positive**: GD, HII, KTOS, AVAV all benefiting from continued rearmament sentiment and NATO spending commitment.
- **NXE** (Tier 2, Nuclear): CNSC Part 2 hearing for Rook I mine wrapping up today (Feb 9-12). Strong Indigenous community support reported at hearings. Decision expected within 120 days of hearing close. Most significant near-term uranium mine catalyst.
- **BKSY** (Tier 3, Space): Quiet but maintaining $322.7M backlog with 91% international exposure and Strong Buy consensus.

## 5. Unusual Options Activity

Specific watchlist-level options flow data was limited in pre-market screens today. Key names to monitor for elevated options activity:

- **ANET**: Earnings tonight -- expect elevated call/put volume and IV compression post-report. Directional bets being placed on AI datacenter spend trajectory.
- **CGNX**: +23% gap-up will drive heavy options activity. Watch for whether institutional call flow confirms the move or put hedging begins at resistance.
- **ALB**: -7% gap-down may draw contrarian call buying at $145-150 support or continuation put activity. Lithium sentiment is the swing factor.
- **PANW**: Earnings in 1 week (Feb 19) -- watch for positioning and IV build.
- **IONQ**: Quantum names carry extreme IV; earnings Feb 25. Watch for unusual call buying as sentiment gauge for quantum.
- **RKLB**: Earnings Feb 26 -- space sector positioning beginning.

---

## Summary: What Matters Most Today

1. **CGNX +23% is the biggest watchlist story this morning.** Q4 beat confirms industrial automation cycle recovery -- positive read-through for ROK, FANUY, TER, and the broader robotics thesis. The $500M buyback signals management confidence. This is a Tier 1 breakout.

2. **ALB -7% is the watchlist disappointment.** Energy Storage volume +17% is constructive for the lithium demand narrative, but the $414M net loss and lack of 2026 revenue guidance create uncertainty. SQM also down ~4%. Lithium thesis structurally intact but near-term headwind from China pricing softness.

3. **ANET earnings tonight are the most important watchlist event of the day.** A beat confirms AI infrastructure capex resilience and supports the entire AI tier (NVDA, TSM, AVGO, VRT). A miss or soft guide would be the first crack in the $650B hyperscaler capex narrative. Consensus: ~$2.38B revenue, ~$0.75 EPS.

4. **Defense sector broadly positive.** LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX all climbing on rearmament sentiment. Lockheed guiding $77.5-80B 2026 sales with "unprecedented demand." RTX framework agreements and NATO 3.5% GDP target provide structural tailwinds.

5. **CPI tomorrow (Feb 13) is the macro risk event.** Hot print pressures all growth and pre-revenue names -- quantum (IONQ, RGTI, QBTS), nuclear SMR (OKLO, SMR), lithium development (LAC), and high-multiple tech. Cool print would be a broad tailwind.

6. **Nuclear/uranium sector steady.** NXE CNSC hearing wrapping today with strong community support. Decision in ~120 days. Palisades restart in the Feb-Mar window is the next major nuclear event. CEG at $308 (analyst target $413) and VST at $167 (target $237) both trading well below consensus targets.

7. **Space names quietly positive.** LUNR +3.2%, PL +2.6%. Artemis II launch March 6 is the next major sentiment catalyst. Morgan Stanley recently turned bullish on space stocks.

8. **Look-ahead priority:** PANW earnings Feb 19, IONQ Feb 25, RKLB Feb 26, **NVDA Feb 26** (the big one).
