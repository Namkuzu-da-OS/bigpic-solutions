| 2Y Yield | 3.470% | — | FRED (prev close) |

| Ethereum | $2,018 | -0.05% | CoinGecko |

**Color:** Equity futures mildly green heading into a holiday-shortened session. The VIX is pinned at 20.60 — elevated but not expanding, suggesting hedges are in place but no immediate panic. The 2s/10s spread at +59 bps reflects a normally sloped curve with the market pricing in continued easing. Gold holding above $5,000 despite modest pullback. Bitcoin bouncing from the weekend $68K flush — crypto still in risk-off mode broadly but the worst of the sell wave may have passed. DXY creeping higher at 96.94, dollar strength reasserting modestly.

## Overnight & Global Markets

| Market | Level | Change | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Nikkei 225 | 56,806 | -0.24% | Schwab |
| Hang Seng | 26,706 | +0.52% | Schwab |
| DAX | 24,917 | +0.01% | Schwab |
| CAC 40 | 8,338 | +0.31% | Schwab |
| FTSE 100 | 10,472 | -0.01% | Stooq |

| Europe STOXX 50 (FEZ) | 68.43 | +1.09% | Schwab |
| Australia (EWA) | 29.16 | +0.21% | Schwab |

**Asia:** Mixed session. Japan soft (-0.24%) as GDP rebound missed expectations — economy avoided technical recession but Q4 growth underwhelmed. Hong Kong continued its China-tech-driven rally (+0.52%), consistent with the Goldman call that Asian markets have further to rally. Korea drifted slightly lower.

**Europe:** STOXX 50 outperformed at +1.09%, validating the "great rotation" from US toward Europe narrative. DAX flat, CAC modestly green. The Munich Security Conference backdrop — Dalio describing the end of the post-war order — weighs on geopolitical sentiment but European equity flows remain robust. The Dassault Systèmes -8% drop on AI fears is a counter-signal for European software names.

## Today's Calendar

| Time (ET) | Event | Impact | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| All Day | **Presidents' Day — U.S. Markets Closed** | — | Bond and equity markets closed |
| 1:25 PM | FOMC Member Bowman Speaks | Low | Watch for any deviation from Fed's easing posture |

Light calendar today due to the holiday. The week ahead is far more active — FOMC meeting minutes are expected this week, which crypto and rates markets are closely watching for signals on the pace of future cuts. Limited CPI and January job data have given space for a growth mandate focus per SPTS commentary.

## Market Context & Playbook

### VIX Regime Assessment
- **VIX:** 20.62, flat
- **Regime:** Elevated — above 20 threshold, signaling hedging demand persists
- **SPY Trend:** Bearish per briefing data
- **Risk Appetite:** Cautious

The VIX at 20.62 in an elevated regime with flat change suggests volatility is priced in but not expanding. This is a "cautious carry" environment — not panic, but not complacency either. The combination of elevated VIX + bearish SPY trend + cautious risk appetite historically favors selective buying in oversold quality names over broad beta exposure.

### Today's Bias: Neutral-to-Cautiously Bullish

**Rationale:**
- Futures green across the board (+0.16% to +0.35%) despite weekend crypto selloff and Munich conference geopolitical pessimism
- Broad-based strength across watchlist sectors — 38 tickers moved >3% to the upside vs. only 1 meaningful decliner
- Easing inflation data giving the Fed space for growth mandate focus
- European rotation providing a constructive global backdrop
- However: markets closed today, limited liquidity, and the week ahead is stacked with catalysts (FOMC minutes, PANW/LDOS/CEG earnings Tuesday, NVDA Feb 25)

**Playbook:**
1. **Use the holiday to prepare for Tuesday's earnings triple-header:** PANW (RSI 33, deeply oversold — potential snap-back if results are clean), LDOS (momentum into earnings with +6.14% today), CEG (nuclear sentiment strong, RSI neutral at 52)
2. **Oversold watchlist candidates for the week:** ZS (RSI 26), ISRG (RSI 28), FLNC (RSI 32), PANW (RSI 33), IONQ (RSI 34) — these are Tier 1/2 names at extreme technical levels
3. **Overbought caution:** CGNX (RSI 89) is the standout — 50%+ above its 200-day. Not a short signal necessarily, but new entries here carry elevated reversal risk
4. **Crypto positioning:** BTC at $69.9K bouncing from $68K. MSTR/RIOT ripping. If BTC stabilizes above $70K, crypto miners could see follow-through. Watch Fed minutes for rates signal

### Key Levels to Watch (Week Ahead)
- **S&P 500:** Previous close 6,836. Futures at 6,874. SMA200 at 649 (SPY) = 6,490 equivalent — well above
- **NVDA $172:** 200-day SMA. Must hold for AI infrastructure thesis
- **VIX 20:** The dividing line between normal and elevated. A break below 20 would signal risk appetite returning
- **BTC $68K:** Weekend low. If this level fails, next support is in the low $60Ks
- **10Y Yield 4.056%:** Holding below the psychologically important 4.1% level. A move higher would pressure growth/tech

### Risk Factors
- **FOMC minutes this week** — any hawkish surprises on rate cut pace would hit rate-sensitive sectors (nuclear utilities, REITs, growth tech)
- **Munich Security Conference fallout** — Dalio's "end of post-war order" comments and the broader geopolitical framing could weigh on European sentiment
- **Crypto contagion** — Bitcoin fell to $68K over the weekend. Leverage-driven volatility threatening the "digital gold" narrative. Watch for institutional capitulation signals
- **Trump tariff escalation** — tariffs raising red flags per Yahoo Finance; aluminum tariff rollback talk bringing "little relief"
- **Tesla European sales collapse** — down 55-93% across major markets. If this hits US sentiment around the TSLA name, energy storage thesis (Megapack) could see collateral pressure despite being a different business
