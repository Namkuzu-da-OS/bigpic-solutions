## Weekend News -- Watchlist Impact

### Defense Sector -- "Security Supercycle" Narrative
Defense stocks hitting all-time highs as NATO rearmament, Golden Dome funding, and munitions replenishment drive structural demand. LMT, RTX, NOC, LHX all trading near 52-week highs. The narrative shifted from cyclical to structural in early 2026.

### NexGen Energy (NXE) -- CNSC Hearing Starts Today
The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission begins Part 2 public hearings on NexGen's Rook I uranium mine project in Saskatoon. This is the final regulatory step before potential approval of the world's largest undeveloped high-grade uranium deposit (30M lbs/yr capacity). Hearings run Feb 9-12 with heavy Indigenous community participation. Volume surged 99% on Friday ahead of the event.

### Google/Wiz EU Decision Tomorrow (Feb 10)
EU antitrust regulators have a February 10 deadline on Alphabet's $32B acquisition of Wiz. Deal expected to receive Phase I clearance (90% of cases resolved in Phase I). US already approved. If cleared, this validates CNAPP at 45-65x ARR and removes an independent cloud security competitor, benefiting CRWD and PANW.

### Lithium Price Weakness
Lithium carbonate fell to 134,500 CNY/T on Feb 6 (-6.6%), dragging ALB (-5-7%) and SQM (-4-6%) lower in pre-market. The lithium price recovery thesis faces near-term headwinds from Chinese spot market weakness, though the supply-demand balance is still projected to tighten toward deficit in 2026.

### FLNC Earnings Miss
Fluence Energy reported an unexpected quarterly loss, driving a 34.6% plunge in shares. Consensus downgraded to Hold with $15.22 price target. The $5.5B backlog remains intact but execution concerns have emerged. This is a Tier 1 watchlist name now trading with elevated risk.

### Quantum Stocks Consolidating After January Selloff
IONQ, QBTS, and RGTI all sold off 10-19% in January on rate uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. February viewed as a consolidation phase. IONQ got a boost Friday (+14%) from Rosenblatt reaffirmation. Quantinuum IPO filing (S-1 filed Jan 2026) remains the most significant upcoming quantum event.

### Rocket Lab (RKLB) Neutron Challenges
RKLB slipped from $96 ATH to ~$72 on Neutron tank test setback. "Hungry Hippo" fairing arrived in Virginia for checkout. Feb 26 earnings call expected to provide updated Neutron schedule. This is the key catalyst for validating the bull case at current valuations.
