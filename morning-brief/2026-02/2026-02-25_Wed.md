# BigPic Morning Brief

## Event Load: HEAVY — Wednesday, February 25, 2026

NVIDIA earnings day. The most consequential single-stock event of the quarter lands before the open, with options pricing the smallest post-earnings swing in three years. Three FOMC speakers are on deck, crude oil inventories report, and President Trump spoke overnight. Crypto is rebounding sharply. The calendar is dense — stay sharp.

| Ethereum | $1,958 | +7.33% | CoinGecko |

**Color:** Green across the board ahead of NVIDIA. Small caps leading (+0.69%) suggests risk appetite is returning. VIX pulling back nearly 3% from the ~19 zone — elevated but not alarming. Gold continues its relentless grind above $5,200. Crypto is the standout: BTC +5% and ETH +7% as the market rebounds from oversold levels with altcoin season indicators revisiting January highs. Yields are dead flat, offering no directional signal. DXY steady near 97.8 — still well off its 2025 highs. The 2s/10s curve remains positively sloped at +60 bps, consistent with the market pricing in an eventual easing cycle.

## Market Context & Playbook

**VIX Regime:** Normal (19.01, declining -2.76%). The VIX is elevated relative to the pre-2026 baseline but within the normal operating range. The declining trend is constructive heading into NVDA earnings.

**SPY Trend:** Bearish per the model. S&P 500 closed flat at 6,890 yesterday. Futures indicate a gap up to 6,926 (+0.33%), but the model flags the intermediate trend as bearish. The 200-day SMA on SPY sits at 652 (ETF level), well below current price.

**Risk Appetite:** Moderate. Small caps outperforming (+0.69% vs +0.33% SPX), crypto surging (+5-7%), and VIX declining all signal improving risk appetite. But SPY trend model remains bearish and the day hinges entirely on NVDA.

**Today's Bias: Cautiously Bullish — with NVDA as the swing factor.**

Rationale:
- Pre-market green across all indices with small caps leading
- VIX declining, crypto rebounding, gold steady
- Positive global session (Nikkei +2.2%)
- Strong earnings pockets (CAVA, Circle, HSBC)
- Fed holding steady — no surprises

**Risks that could flip the bias:**
- NVDA earnings miss or weak guidance (would crater Nasdaq, ripple across AI infrastructure names)
- Trump speech overnight — check for tariff escalation signals
- Workday -9% and HP -5.5% show market punishing weak forward guidance harshly
- Goldman Sachs says AI boosted US economy by "basically zero" in 2025 — narrative risk for the AI capex cycle

**Key Levels to Watch:**
- S&P 500: 6,926 futures — watch for ability to hold above 6,900 on any post-NVDA volatility
- Nasdaq 100: 25,139 futures — anomalous (z-score 3.1), driven by NVDA anticipation
- VIX: 19.01 — a break below 18 would confirm risk-on; above 21 signals renewed stress
- 10Y: 4.033% — flat and range-bound, not a factor today
- Bitcoin: $66,187 — reclaimed $65K, miners bouncing, potential bottom signal after longest mining capitulation nearing end
