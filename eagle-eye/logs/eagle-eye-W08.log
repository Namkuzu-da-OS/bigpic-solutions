Eagle Eye W08 is complete. Here's what's in `/home/spicymeatball/projects/bigpic-markets/eagle-eye/W08_2026-02-22/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_equities_sectors.md` | Equities, sectors, earnings, breadth, thesis watchlist |
| `02_rates_credit_fed.md` | Treasury yields, FOMC minutes, Fed speakers, credit, liquidity |
| `03_commodities_forex.md` | Oil, gold, copper, uranium, forex, supply chain |
| `04_crypto_alternative.md` | BTC, ETH, altcoins, ETF flows, mining, regulation |
| `VERIFICATION.md` | Cross-check results — PASS with minor corrections applied |
| `EAGLE_EYE.md` | Final compiled report |

**Verification summary:** All major data points confirmed. One GDP consensus estimate discrepancy (2.5% vs 2.9-3.0% depending on source) — addressed in the final report by not anchoring to a single consensus number. Gold ($5,107), SPX (6,909.51), BTC (~$68,000), 10Y (4.08%), WTI (~$66.30) all verified.

**Top headlines for the week:**
- SCOTUS 6-3 strikes down IEEPA tariffs (Feb 20)
- FOMC minutes reveal three-way split with rate hikes on the table
- Stagflation signal: Q4 GDP 1.4% + core PCE 3.0%
- Energy sector +14% YTD, leading all sectors by wide margin
- Gold above $5,100 on Iran tensions + sovereign debt fears
- Crypto bear deepens: Fear & Greed at 8, ETF outflows $3.8B over 5 weeks
- NVIDIA earnings (Feb 25) is the week ahead's make-or-break event
