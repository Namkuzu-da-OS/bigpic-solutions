# Commodities & Forex — Week Ending 2026-02-13

## Summary

Commodities and forex markets this week were shaped by a cooler-than-expected US CPI print (2.4% YoY headline, eight-month low) and the NexGen Energy CNSC hearing for the Rook I uranium mine. WTI crude slipped below $63/bbl as OPEC+ signaled a potential April production increase, while gold surged past $4,980 on rate-cut expectations reinforced by the inflation data. The dollar index (DXY) fell below 97 for the first time since mid-2021 as markets priced in Fed easing, dragging DXY to 96.88. Copper traded sideways near $5.90/lb amid Lunar New Year demand lulls. Rare earth prices continued their relentless climb, with NdPr oxide up 37% YTD, while uranium pulled back from January highs as the CNSC hearing concluded without an immediate ruling. The week's CPI print was the dominant macro catalyst, lifting precious metals and pressuring the dollar across the board.

## Energy

| Commodity | Close (Feb 13) | Weekly % | Driver |
|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| WTI Crude | $62.81/bbl | -1.4% | OPEC+ April production increase reports; IEA glut forecast of 3.84M bpd surplus |
| Brent Crude | $67.57/bbl | -0.7% | Saudi OSP cuts continue; US-Iran talks remain inconclusive |
| Natural Gas (Henry Hub) | ~$3.50/MMBtu | +2.3% | LNG export flows rising; mild February weather forecasts capped upside |

**Drivers:**
- OPEC+ reaffirmed its Q1 2026 output pause on Feb 1, but Reuters reported on Feb 13 that the group is considering an April production increase, citing rising prices from US-Iran tensions and a desire by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to reclaim market share. This weighed on crude late in the week. [1][2]
- The IEA's projection of global oil supply surpassing demand by 3.84M bpd in 2026 continues to cap upside. Saudi Arabia's fourth consecutive monthly OSP cut for Arab Light to Asia (to +$0.30/bbl) reflects soft Asian demand. [3]
- The EIA raised its 2026 WTI forecast on Feb 13, but lowered 2027 projections, reinforcing the near-term range-bound thesis. [4]
- Natural gas rebounded from a 25.7% one-day crash on Feb 2 (the largest single-day decline in 30 years). Higher LNG terminal flows supported the recovery, but mild mid-February weather limited the bounce. [5]

## Precious Metals

| Metal | Close (Feb 13) | Weekly % | Note |
|-------|----------------|----------|------|
| Gold | ~$4,984/oz | +1.1% | CPI at 2.4% reinforced rate-cut expectations; safe-haven bid intact |
| Silver | ~$78.90/oz | +1.2% | Stabilizing after Jan 29 crash from $121 record; UBS targets $100 by March |

**Drivers:**
- Gold rallied above $4,980 on Feb 13 after the January CPI report showed headline inflation at 2.4% -- an eight-month low. Markets now expect the Fed to cut rates, which weakened the dollar and boosted gold. [6][7]
- Gold has recovered from the sharp sell-off that followed January's forced liquidation cascade but remains below the $5,100 highs. Central bank buying, geopolitical uncertainty, and real rate compression continue to support the structural bull case.
- Silver is stabilizing in the $77-79 range after the volatile crash from $121 (Jan 29). Exchange margin hikes triggered massive liquidations that erased all YTD gains within days. UBS maintains a $100 target by March before easing to $85 by year-end. [8]

## Industrial & Critical Minerals

| Commodity | Level (Feb 13) | Move | Note |
|-----------|----------------|------|------|
| Copper (LME) | ~$5.90/lb | Flat | Lunar New Year demand lull; structural deficit from 2026 per ICSG |
| Uranium (U3O8 spot) | ~$88/lb | +3.2% WoW | Pullback from Jan $94.28 peak; NexGen CNSC hearing concluded Feb 12 |
| Lithium Carbonate (China) | ~CNY 155,000/t | -3.1% | Retreating from CNY 180K Jan high; 27 Jiangxi mining permits canceled |
| NdPr Oxide | ~CNY 1,065,000/t Nd | +37.2% YTD | China export controls driving scarcity premium; +40% YTD for Pr |
| Cobalt | ~$56,290/t | +2.7% MoM | DRC quota system sustaining elevated prices; +161% YoY |

**Key developments:**
- **Copper** traded sideways near $5.90/lb as Chinese buyers remained sidelined ahead of Lunar New Year. ICSG projects a 150,000-tonne copper deficit starting 2026, with J.P. Morgan estimating 330,000 MT. Freeport-McMoRan's phased Grasberg restart in Q2 2026 is the key near-term supply catalyst. [9]
- **Uranium** rebounded to ~$88/lb after touching $85.25 earlier in February. NexGen Energy's critical CNSC Part 2 hearing for the Rook I project concluded Feb 12 in Saskatoon. Four Indigenous Nations expressed support for approval. No decision was issued; the CNSC has a 120-day service standard to issue a written ruling. This remains the single most important near-term catalyst for uranium supply. [10][11]
- **Lithium** pulled back to ~CNY 155,000/t from the January surge above CNY 180,000, as markets reassessed demand uplift. The cancellation of 27 mining permits in Jiangxi (a key Chinese lithium hub) and Beijing's commitment to double EV charging capacity to 180 GW by 2027 support the structural outlook. Prices remain dramatically above the 2025 trough of $10-11K/t. [12]
- **Rare earths (NdPr)** extended their rally with Neodymium at CNY 1,065,000/t (+37% YTD) and Praseodymium at ~$202/kg (+40% YTD). NdPr oxide remains near the $90-100K/t range. The November 2026 expiry of the US-China trade agreement suspension is the dominant forward catalyst, with analysts assigning 35% probability to full reimposition of Chinese export controls. [13]
- **Cobalt** remained elevated near $56,290/t, up 161% YoY, sustained by the DRC export quota system (~96,000 MT/yr, roughly half of 2024 volumes). [14]

## Forex

| Pair | Level (Feb 13) | Weekly % | Driver |
|------|----------------|----------|--------|
| DXY | 96.88 | -0.8% | CPI at 2.4% reinforced Fed rate-cut expectations; broke below 97 |
| EUR/USD | 1.1862 | +0.4% | Dollar weakness; euro held gains after earlier 1.2000 breach |
| USD/JPY | 152.58 | -2.6% | LDP won snap election (Feb 8); yen strengthened on BOJ tightening expectations |
| GBP/USD | 1.3639 | +0.3% | BOE dovish hold at 3.75%; pound supported by broad dollar weakness |

**Key themes:**
- **DXY broke below 97** for the first time since mid-2021. The January CPI at 2.4% (below 2.5% consensus) was the catalyst, reinforcing market expectations for multiple Fed rate cuts in 2026. The dollar index has now fallen ~10% from its 2025 highs. [15][16]
- **USD/JPY** saw the week's largest move, falling 2.6% to 152.58 after the ruling LDP won Japan's Feb 8 snap election decisively. Markets interpreted the result as clearing the path for continued BOJ tightening. Reports of a Fed "rate check" in January provided additional yen support. [17]
- **EUR/USD** edged higher to 1.1862. The euro briefly broke 1.2000 earlier in 2026 (first time since June 2021) and has maintained strength amid ECB rate holds and dollar weakness. [18]
- **GBP/USD** rose to 1.3639 as the BOE's dovish hold at 3.75% was offset by broad dollar selling. [19]

## Supply Chain & Trade

**Baltic Dry Index:** Fell to ~1,882 (-2.1% WoW), a seven-session losing streak driven by reduced iron ore shipping demand ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year. The Capesize index declined to 2,918 (-1.1%), while Panamax (-0.4% to 1,652) and Supramax (+0.2% to 1,104) were mixed. [20]

**Trade policy developments (Feb 10-14):**
- On Feb 10, House Republicans failed to extend the prohibition barring the chamber from canceling Trump tariffs, with three Republicans voting against. On Feb 11, six House Republicans crossed party lines to vote to end tariffs on Canada -- a sign of growing bipartisan tariff fatigue. [21]
- India reciprocal tariff was lowered from 25% to 18% following the Feb 10 White House Fact Sheet update, after India's purchase of Russian oil. [21]
- The 25% revenue-sharing tariff on advanced semiconductors (Presidential Proclamation 11002) continues to create logistical hurdles for TSMC and other chipmakers required to route chips through US-based testing labs. [22]
- UNCTAD's February 2026 Global Trade Update highlighted shifting trade flows: US imports of South African goods are 17 percentage points more expensive vs. 2024 due to tariff gaps, while Italian rice has become 12 points cheaper. [23]
