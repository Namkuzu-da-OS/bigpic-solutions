# Eagle Eye Weekly — W07 | Week Ending 2026-02-13

## This Week's Take

**The AI Reckoning deepened.** What began as a SaaS-specific selloff in W06 metastasized into a broad-based reckoning with AI disruption. Software stocks lost $1 trillion in market cap this week alone, extending the S&P North American software index to a 15% monthly decline — the worst since October 2008. But the damage spread beyond tech: AI automation fears hit financials (robo-advisory), trucking (autonomous logistics), and real estate (AI property management), producing the broadest AI-driven selloff yet. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 6,836 — fractionally negative for 2026 — while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1% for its third consecutive week of underperformance.

The week's macro bright spot — a cooler-than-expected January CPI print (headline 2.4% YoY, core 2.5% YoY — the lowest since April 2021) — barely registered. The S&P gained just 0.05% on Friday as investors remained fixated on AI's expanding displacement footprint rather than rate-cut tailwinds. The 10-year Treasury fell 18 bps to 4.04%, and CME FedWatch surged to 80%+ odds of a June cut, but the bond rally couldn't lift equities. When good inflation data can't move stocks, the fear narrative is in control.

The earnings split told the story in two sentences: Applied Materials surged 13% on 75% YoY EPS growth and record DRAM revenue, while Shopify fell 6% despite 31% revenue growth because the market is punishing anything AI can threaten. Infrastructure builders (AMAT, ANET) are being rewarded; software companies (NOW, CRM, INTU) are being repriced for a post-AI world.

**Key signal:** AMAT +13% and ANET +10% post-earnings while SaaS lost $1T — the market is rewarding builders and punishing the disrupted.

## Sector Heatmap

| Rank | Sector | ETF | Weekly % | Signal |
|------|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Energy | XLE | +0.5% | Commodity prices firm; AI power demand narrative |
| 2 | Materials | XLB | +0.3% | Continued rotation beneficiary; copper strength |
| 3 | Utilities | XLU | +0.2% | Nuclear plays (CEG +4.5%, VST +14.6%) lifting sector |
| 4 | Industrials | XLI | -0.3% | Gave back some W06 gains; still leading YTD |
| 5 | Healthcare | XLV | -0.5% | Defensive positioning; mixed pharma earnings |
| 6 | Consumer Staples | XLP | -0.7% | Coca-Cola beat provided some support |
| 7 | Real Estate | XLRE | -1.0% | AI disruption fears hit property management |
| 8 | Consumer Disc. | XLY | -1.2% | Amazon aftershocks from W06 capex guidance |
| 9 | Financials | XLF | -1.5% | AI automation fears spread to banking/insurance |
| 10 | Comm. Services | XLC | -2.0% | Alphabet/Meta capex overhang persists |
| 11 | Technology | XLK | -2.8% | Third straight week of underperformance; SaaS rout deepens |

**Rotation narrative:** The "Great Sector Rotation" from W06 persisted but with a darker edge — AI disruption fears that had been confined to enterprise software spread into financials, trucking, and real estate. Three dynamics: (1) Software carnage accelerating — ServiceNow -28% YTD, Salesforce -26% YTD, Intuit -34% YTD, the worst monthly decline since 2008. (2) "Tangible Economy" leadership consolidating — industrials, energy, materials, and defense continue leading. (3) CPI relief was short-lived — rate cuts alone cannot solve an existential threat to business models.

## Fed & Rates Outlook

### Current Policy
- **Fed Funds Rate:** 3.50%-3.75% (held Jan 28, 10-2 vote; Miran + Waller dissented for cut)
- **10-Year Treasury:** 4.04% (down 18 bps; CPI-driven rally)
- **2s10s Spread:** +62 bps (positively sloped)

### Rate Expectations (CME FedWatch)
| Meeting | Hold | 25bp Cut | 50bp+ Cut |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| March 18 | ~60% | ~38% | ~2% |
| June 2026 | ~20% | ~50% | ~30% |
| Sept 2026 | ~10% | ~35% | ~55% |
| Dec 2026 | ~8% | ~22% | ~70% |

**Full-year:** Markets now price approximately **three rate cuts (75 bps)** by year-end — up from two the prior week. June first cut surged past 80% probability. March remains a coin-flip: the strong jobs report argues against, but the CPI trend argues for. Miran's call for >100 bps of cuts is now closer to market pricing.

### Key Fed Speakers This Week
- **Beth Hammack (Cleveland, Feb 10):** Rates could be on hold for "some time"; emphasized patience and Fed independence — hawkish-hold
- **Lorie Logan (Dallas, Feb 10):** Not fully confident inflation heading to 2%; warned against premature cuts — hawkish-hold

### Key Economic Data
| Data Point | Actual | Expected | Signal |
|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Jan NFP | +130K | +55K | Beat; healthcare/social assistance heavy |
| Jan Unemployment | 4.3% | 4.4% | Edged lower |
| Jan CPI Headline YoY | **2.4%** | 2.5% | Beat; lowest since May 2025 |
| Jan CPI Headline MoM | **+0.2%** | +0.3% | Beat |
| Jan CPI Core YoY | **2.5%** | 2.6% | Lowest since April 2021 |
| Jan CPI Core MoM | +0.3% | +0.3% | In-line |
| Initial Claims | 227K | 222K | Slightly elevated |

**CPI deep dive:** Shelter rose just 0.2% MoM (annual rate 3.0%, down from 3.3%). Energy fell 1.5%. Used cars dropped 1.8%. Core goods continue deflating while core services (ex-shelter) are decelerating. The headline beat was the cleanest disinflation print the Fed has seen in over a year.

### Credit Markets
- **IG OAS:** ~78 bps (2nd percentile — historically tight)
- **HY OAS:** ~292 bps (+6 bps WoW; orderly normalization near long-term mean)
- **Notable issuance:** Alphabet $20B seven-part offering; Oracle $25B; Morgan Stanley projects $2.3T 2026 IG issuance

## Positioning & Thesis Update

### Conviction Changes
| Thesis | Direction | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| AI Infrastructure | **Cautious** (maintain) | Earnings split stark — AMAT +13%, ANET +10% but PLTR -27% YTD, AMD -4%. Physical layer builders winning; software-adjacent names losing. "4% monetization problem" persists |
| Nuclear Energy | **Bullish** (maintain) | VST +14.6% (week's top thesis performer), CEG +4.5%. Rate cuts improve utility valuations. NexGen hearing concluded. Physical power demand insulated from AI disruption fears |
| Critical Minerals | **Bullish** (maintain) | NdPr +37% YTD, MP +1.3%. Structural deficits intact across copper, uranium, rare earths. China export controls tightening. Dollar weakness supports commodity prices |
| Defense | **Bullish** (maintain) | LMT +2.4%, RKLB +2.2%, AVAV +2.0%. Safe haven in AI rotation; backlogs and contract momentum provide earnings visibility. Bipartisan support intact |
| Energy Storage | **Neutral** (upgrade to cautious-bullish) | Rate decline strongly positive for FLNC/EOSE project economics. Three cuts priced = meaningful improvement in unit economics. QS binary outcome still dominates |
| Cybersecurity | **Mixed** (was cautious) | CRWD +3.4% resilient vs SaaS peers; PANW -2.5%, ZS -5%, OKTA -6%. Defense-adjacent cyber (LDOS, CACI) outperforming; commercial pure-plays still under SaaS rotation pressure |
| Quantum Computing | **Speculative** (maintain) | IONQ -8%, RGTI -10%. Caught in tech selloff. Q4 earnings Feb 25 is the key binary event. Rate cuts help multiples but execution dominates |
| Robotics | **Neutral** (maintain) | SYM +2% on industrial rotation; ISRG -2% on multiple compression. Physical automation thesis intact |
| Space | **Bullish** (maintain) | RKLB +2.2%; SDA contracts $1.33B+. AST offering drag on sector peers. Neutron development on track |

### Key Risks
1. **AI disruption contagion:** Fears spreading beyond SaaS into financials, logistics, real estate — could trigger broader de-risking if earnings guidance reflects displacement
2. **CPI complacency:** Core MoM was in-line at +0.3%, not a beat — one more hot reading resets the entire rate-cut narrative
3. **Software bear market deepening:** -15% monthly decline is worst since 2008; capitulation selling could accelerate if support levels break
4. **FOMC minutes hawkish surprise:** If January minutes reveal broad opposition to near-term cuts, March pricing collapses
5. **Tariff policy uncertainty:** House Republicans breaking ranks suggests tariff regime may be unstable — creates two-way risk for trade-sensitive names
