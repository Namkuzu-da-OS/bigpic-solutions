# Equities & Sectors -- Week Ending 2026-02-13

## Market Summary

The week of February 10-13 extended the "Great Sector Rotation" narrative into a second consecutive chapter, but with a darker twist: AI disruption fears that had been confined to SaaS/software stocks metastasized into financials, trucking, and real estate, producing the broadest AI-driven selloff yet. The S&P 500 fell 1.39% to close at 6,832.76, the Dow dropped 1.23% to 49,451, and the Nasdaq led declines with a 2.10% loss to 22,597. The week's lone macro bright spot -- a softer-than-expected January CPI print (headline 2.4% YoY vs 2.5% expected, MoM 0.2% vs 0.3%) released on Friday -- failed to sustain a meaningful rally, as investors remained fixated on AI's expanding displacement footprint.

The week's defining narrative was the intensification of what Bloomberg termed "AI morphing into the villain of the stock market it powered for years." Software stocks lost $1 trillion in market cap for the week alone, extending the S&P North American software index's losses to 15% in the prior month -- the worst stretch since October 2008. Wall Street analysts from JPMorgan and Bank of America began calling the selling "overdone," with JPMorgan citing "overly bearish outlook on AI disruption and solid fundamentals" as grounds for a software rebound, but buyers remained scarce.

Notably, the rotation pattern from W06 persisted but with less conviction in the "Old Economy" trade: while materials and energy held up relatively well, even cyclicals saw some profit-taking as the broad market weakened. The Russell 2000, which had surged 3.6% in W06, showed mixed results -- initially rallying on the CPI data as rate-cut hopes reignited, but giving back gains as AI disruption fears broadened beyond tech into small-cap-heavy sectors like regional banking and logistics.

## Index Performance

| Index | Close (Feb 13) | Weekly % | YTD % (est.) |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| S&P 500 | 6,832.76 | -1.39% | -0.2% |
| Nasdaq Composite | 22,597.15 | -2.10% | -1.9% |
| Dow Jones Industrial Average | 49,451 | -1.23% | +3.5% |
| Russell 2000 | ~2,660 (est.) | -1.5% (est.) | +2.0% (est.) |

**Notes:** The S&P 500 closed 2025 at 6,845.50, putting the index fractionally negative for the year. The Dow's retreat from its historic 50,000 milestone set in W06 left it still solidly positive YTD. The Nasdaq's underperformance widened as AI/software selloff entered its third consecutive week. Markets were closed Monday, February 16 for Presidents' Day, making this a four-day trading week.

## Sector Performance

| Rank | Sector | ETF | Weekly % (est.) | Signal |
|------|--------|-----|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Energy | XLE | +0.5% | Relative strength; commodity prices firm, AI power demand narrative |
| 2 | Materials | XLB | +0.3% | Continued rotation beneficiary; copper strength |
| 3 | Utilities | XLU | +0.2% | Nuclear/AI power plays (CEG, VST) lifting the sector |
| 4 | Industrials | XLI | -0.3% | Gave back some W06 gains; still leading YTD |
| 5 | Healthcare | XLV | -0.5% | Defensive positioning; mixed pharma earnings |
| 6 | Consumer Staples | XLP | -0.7% | Coca-Cola beat provided some support |
| 7 | Real Estate | XLRE | -1.0% | Newly hit by AI disruption fears (automated property mgmt) |
| 8 | Consumer Discretionary | XLY | -1.2% | Pulled lower by Amazon aftershocks from W06 |
| 9 | Financials | XLF | -1.5% | AI automation fears spreading to banking/insurance |
| 10 | Communication Services | XLC | -2.0% | Alphabet/Meta capex overhang persists |
| 11 | Technology | XLK | -2.8% | Third straight week of underperformance; software rout deepening |

## Sector Rotation Analysis

The "Great Sector Rotation of 2026" -- first identified in W06 -- continued to deepen, but the week revealed an important evolution: the AI disruption thesis is no longer confined to enterprise software. Bloomberg and Fortune reported that AI automation fears spread into financial services (robo-advisory, automated underwriting), trucking (autonomous logistics), and real estate (AI property management), suggesting the market is beginning to price a broader structural displacement risk across the economy.

Three dynamics are worth tracking:

**1. Software Carnage Accelerating:** ServiceNow -28% YTD, Salesforce -26% YTD, Intuit -34% YTD, Thomson Reuters -28% YTD. The S&P North American software index's 15% monthly decline is the worst since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan and BofA are calling for a rebound on fundamental grounds, but the selling has been institutional and systematic -- not the kind of panic that reverses quickly.

**2. "Tangible Economy" Leadership Consolidating:** The Seeking Alpha Equity Sector Rotation Chartbook for February 2026 confirms that industrials, energy, materials, and non-US equities are leading, while technology, communication services, and financials lag. This is a structural shift from the AI-fueled tech leadership of 2024-2025.

**3. CPI Relief Was Short-Lived:** The softer January CPI (2.4% YoY headline, 2.5% core) should have been bullish for rate-sensitive growth stocks, but the market's muted response (+0.05% S&P on Friday) suggests AI disruption fears are now dominating the macro narrative. Rate cuts alone cannot solve an existential threat to business models.

## Key Earnings

| Date | Company | Ticker | EPS vs Est | Revenue | Market Reaction | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Feb 10 | Coca-Cola | KO | $0.58 vs $0.56 | $11.8B vs $11.6B est (+2% YoY) | +2% | Organic rev +5%; 2026 guide: organic rev +4-5%, EPS +7-8% |
| Feb 11 | McDonald's | MCD | $3.12 adj | $7.0B (+10% YoY) | +1% | SSS +5.7%; MONOPOLY drove record digital acquisition |
| Feb 11 | Shopify | SHOP | $0.48 adj vs $0.51 | $3.67B vs $3.59B (+31% YoY) | -6% | GMV crossed $100B; Q1 guide "low-thirties" growth; $2B buyback |
| Feb 11 | Cisco | CSCO | $1.04 vs $1.02 | Beat estimates | +2% | Silicon One G300 (102.4Tbps) targets AI cluster networking |
| Feb 12 | Coinbase | COIN | $0.66 vs $0.83 | $1.78B vs $1.86B | -8% | GAAP loss $667M on crypto mark-downs; FY25 revenue grew YoY |
| Feb 12 | Arista Networks | ANET | $0.82 adj vs $0.76 | $2.48B vs $2.39B (+29% YoY) | +10% AH | Surpassed $1B quarterly net income; AI networking target raised to $3.25B |
| Feb 12 | Applied Materials | AMAT | $2.38 vs $2.21 | $7.01B vs $6.88B | +13% | GAAP EPS $2.54 (+75% YoY); record DRAM revenue; Q2 guide $7.65B |

**Key Takeaway:** The earnings split was stark -- semiconductor and infrastructure companies (AMAT, ANET) delivered blowout results reflecting the physical layer of the AI buildout, while software and crypto names (SHOP, COIN) either missed or were penalized for slight shortfalls. This mirrors the broader rotation: investors are rewarding companies that build AI infrastructure and punishing those whose business models AI threatens to displace.

## Market Breadth

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| NYSE Advance/Decline (Feb 13) | 2.17:1 decliners | Broadly negative; third day of selling |
| Nasdaq A/D Ratio (Feb 13) | 2.74:1 decliners | Tech/growth weakness widespread |
| NYSE New 52-Week Highs | 748 | Still elevated in industrials/defense/energy |
| NYSE New 52-Week Lows | 229 | Rising; concentrated in software/SaaS |
| S&P 500 New Highs | 99 | Rotation-driven; concentrated in value sectors |
| S&P 500 New Lows | 32 | Increasing from W06 levels |

**Analysis:** The breadth data confirms a deeply bifurcated market. The high count of new 52-week highs (748 on NYSE) alongside an elevated 229 new lows is unusual and reflects the rotation -- Old Economy names are breaking out to new highs even as software/SaaS stocks are breaking down to new lows. The 2.17:1 NYSE decline ratio and 2.74:1 Nasdaq decline ratio on Thursday showed selling accelerating into the week's close despite Friday's softer CPI.

## Volatility

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| VIX Close (Feb 13) | 20.60 | +18% for the week |
| VIX Weekly High | ~22 | Hit during Thursday's selloff |
| VIX Weekly Low | ~17.5 | Monday's open |
| VIX Monthly Avg (Feb) | ~19.5 | Elevated vs historical average |

**Analysis:** The VIX surged 18% for the week, reflecting intensifying AI-driven uncertainty. The move from ~17.5 to 20.60 pushed the index above its long-run average of ~19-20, signaling that the AI disruption narrative is generating genuine systemic volatility rather than sector-specific noise. The VIX remained elevated despite Friday's benign CPI, suggesting options markets are pricing continued uncertainty through earnings season and into the FOMC meeting cycle.
