# Crypto & Alternative Assets — Week Ending 2026-02-13

## Summary

Crypto markets stabilized this week after the violent selloff that defined early February, but the recovery was uneven and fragile. Bitcoin held a narrow range between $65,800 and $69,500 before closing near $68,900 on February 13 — up roughly 3-4% for the week — following the prior week's crash to $60,255. Ethereum consolidated around $1,950, struggling to reclaim $2,000 resistance. The total crypto market cap sat near $2.36 trillion with Bitcoin dominance at 56-57%, reflecting continued capital concentration in BTC over altcoins.

The week's most consequential development was the institutional signal from BlackRock, which listed its $2.2 billion BUIDL tokenized Treasury fund on Uniswap — the world's largest asset manager taking its first direct step into DeFi trading infrastructure. UNI surged 25% on the news before fading. This move legitimizes on-chain finance at a level that no prior TradFi partnership has matched.

Bitcoin spot ETFs reversed their outflow streak with $616 million in consecutive inflows on February 7-10, though Ethereum ETFs continued bleeding with $161 million in net outflows for the week. The mining sector absorbed a historic blow: Bitcoin difficulty dropped 11% on February 9 — the steepest decline since China's 2021 mining ban — as hash rate fell 20% from its January all-time high above 1 ZH/s. Mining hash price hit a record low of $33.31/PH/day on February 2, pushing marginal operators into unprofitable territory.

Coinbase reported Q4 2025 earnings on February 12, missing estimates with $0.66 EPS versus $0.83 expected. Revenue of $1.78 billion fell short of the $1.86 billion forecast, and the company swung to a $667 million net loss driven by $718 million in unrealized crypto investment losses. Despite the miss, Coinbase showcased record subscription and services revenue (up 5.5x from the 2021 peak) and launched Agentic Wallets on February 11 — AI agent infrastructure for autonomous on-chain transactions. Strategy (MSTR) surged 9% on February 13 after reporting Q4 revenue of $123 million (beating the $118.5 million estimate) and disclosing 714,644 BTC in holdings, even as the company reported a $12.4 billion Q4 net loss from mark-to-market declines.

The regulatory landscape continued to advance: a second White House Crypto Policy Council meeting on February 10 directed banking and crypto stakeholders to propose language for market structure legislation, the FDIC extended its GENIUS Act implementation comment period to May 18, and the CFTC withdrew prior guidance restricting prediction market event contracts. JPMorgan issued a bullish note forecasting institutional-led crypto flow recovery for the rest of 2026.

## ETF Flows

### Bitcoin Spot ETFs

| Fund | Weekly Flow (est.) | Note |
|------|-------------------|------|
| IBIT (BlackRock) | Positive | Leading inflows; $142M single-day inflow early Feb |
| FBTC (Fidelity) | Positive | $153M single-day inflow; led daily flows |
| GBTC (Grayscale) | Modest positive | $15M inflow |
| **Weekly Net** | **+$311M to +$616M** | **First back-to-back inflows in a month (Feb 7-10: $616M)** |

Bitcoin ETFs reversed their outflow streak starting February 7, with $471.1 million inflows on Feb 7 and $144.9 million on Feb 10 [6]. By mid-week, $311 million in net inflows were recorded [6]. CNBC reported that ETF flows, while down, are not signaling a "crypto winter" [7].

### Ethereum Spot ETFs

| Fund | Weekly Flow (est.) | Note |
|------|-------------------|------|
| ETHA (BlackRock) | Large outflows | Largest single-fund withdrawals |
| **Weekly Net** | **-$161M** | **Fourth consecutive week of outflows** |

## Crypto-Equities

| Ticker | Close Feb 13 | Weekly % (est.) | Note |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------|
| COIN (Coinbase) | ~$164.50 | +12% (rebound) | Q4 miss: $0.66 EPS vs $0.83 est.; $1.78B rev vs $1.86B est.; Agentic Wallets launch Feb 11 |
| MSTR (Strategy) | ~$148 | +9% | Q4 rev beat ($123M vs $118.5M est.); 714,644 BTC; $12.4B net loss from BTC mark-to-market |
| MARA | ~$7.93 | Flat | Mining profitability severely stressed; hash price at record lows |
| RIOT | ~$6.50 (est.) | -5% (est.) | HPC diversification pivot ongoing; mining under pressure |
| CLSK (CleanSpark) | Declined | -5% (est.) | Most advanced HPC diversification among miners |

**Coinbase Q4 2025 Earnings (Feb 12):** Full-year 2025 results showed $6.9 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in net profit, but Q4 swung to a $667 million net loss driven by $718 million in unrealized crypto investment losses and $395 million in strategic investment losses [10]. Subscription and services revenue hit an all-time high, up 5.5x from the 2021 peak. Coinbase completed 10 acquisitions in 2025, including the Deribit derivatives exchange — the largest crypto M&A deal ever. Q1 2026 guidance: transaction revenue ~$420 million through Feb 10; subscription/services revenue expected $550-$630 million [10].

**Coinbase Agentic Wallets (Feb 11):** Coinbase launched the first wallet infrastructure built for AI agents, enabling autonomous spending, earning, and trading with enterprise-grade security guardrails via the x402 protocol (50M+ transactions processed) [11].

**Strategy (MSTR) Q4 2025 Earnings (Feb 5, reported W06):** Disclosed 714,644 BTC holdings (including 41,002 acquired in January 2026 alone) at an average cost of $66,385 per BTC. Total acquisition cost: $33.1 billion. Raised $25.3 billion in capital during 2025, making it the largest equity issuer among U.S. public companies for a second consecutive year. H.C. Wainwright raised price target to $540 from $500 [12].

## DeFi & Stablecoins

### DeFi

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total DeFi TVL | ~$105-115B (down from $130-140B pre-crash) |
| Lido | ~$27.5B TVL (liquid staking leader) |
| Aave | ~$27B TVL (largest lending protocol, 18 chains) |
| EigenLayer | ~$13B TVL |
| Uniswap | ~$6.8B TVL; BlackRock BUIDL listing drove major headlines |
| Maker | ~$5.2B TVL |

DeFi TVL declined in lockstep with underlying asset prices — dropping roughly 12-20% from the $130-140B range in early 2026 to approximately $105-115B — but no major protocol failures occurred during the stress test [13]. Aave and Lido maintained their positions as the two largest protocols. The BlackRock BUIDL-Uniswap integration was the week's signature DeFi event, representing the most significant TradFi-DeFi convergence to date [14].

### Stablecoins

| Stablecoin | Market Cap | Share |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| USDT (Tether) | $187.3B | ~60.2% |
| USDC (Circle) | $75.7B | ~24.5% |
| Total Stablecoin Market | $307-314B | Record high |

Stablecoin market cap remained at record highs through the crash, indicating capital rotated from volatile crypto assets into stablecoins rather than exiting the ecosystem entirely [15]. USDC outpaced USDT in growth rate for the second consecutive year (73% vs. 36% in 2025), driven by regulatory compliance demand [16]. The sustained record stablecoin cap signals significant dry powder available for re-entry when sentiment stabilizes.

---

## Mining

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hash Rate | ~780 EH/s (est.), down 20% from ATH >1 ZH/s |
| Difficulty | 125.86T (after -11% adjustment Feb 9) |
| Hash Price | $33.31/PH/day record low (Feb 2) |
| Next Adjustment | Feb 20 (est. +10.9% to ~139.6T) |

The February 9 difficulty adjustment was the largest downward move since China's 2021 mining ban, dropping 11% from 141.6T to 125.86T [17]. Two factors drove the hash rate decline: (1) Bitcoin's 50%+ drawdown from its October 2025 ATH of ~$126,000 crushing miner profitability, and (2) severe winter storms in Texas forcing grid operators to issue curtailment requests, pushing large-scale miners to power down [18]. Hash price hit a record low of $33.31/PH/day on February 2, pushing many miners into unprofitable territory. The difficulty adjustment provides near-term relief for surviving miners, though the next adjustment (Feb 20) is projected to increase difficulty back toward 139.6T as hash rate recovers.

## Regulatory Developments

| Development | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| White House Crypto Council | Second meeting held Feb 10; banking and crypto stakeholders directed to return with proposed language for market structure legislation [19] |
| FDIC GENIUS Act Extension | 90-day comment period extended to May 18 for stablecoin subsidiary rulemaking for FDIC-supervised banks [20] |
| CFTC Event Contracts | Withdrew prior guidance restricting prediction market event contracts (Feb 4); formal rulemaking planned [20] |
| CLARITY Act | 278-page market structure bill (Jan 12 draft) advancing; prohibits yield on stablecoin balances [21] |
| JPMorgan Outlook | Bullish note (Feb 11): expects institutional-led digital asset flow recovery in 2026 [22] |
| Coinbase Agentic Wallets | First AI agent wallet infrastructure launched (Feb 11); x402 protocol for machine-to-machine payments [11] |

The regulatory environment continues to be the most constructive in crypto history. Both market structure (CLARITY Act) and stablecoin (GENIUS Act) legislation are advancing simultaneously, with the White House actively mediating between banking and crypto stakeholders [19]. The CFTC's withdrawal of restrictive event contract guidance is a positive for prediction market platforms [20]. The stablecoin yield prohibition in the CLARITY Act draft remains a significant negative for DeFi yield protocols and a win for traditional banks [21].
