# Rates, Credit & Fed -- Week Ending 2026-02-13

## Summary

The dominant narrative this week was a two-act drama: a stronger-than-expected January jobs report on Tuesday that briefly pushed yields higher, followed by a decisive CPI beat on Thursday that ignited a broad Treasury rally and sent the 10-year to its lowest level since mid-2025. January CPI printed at 2.4% headline (vs. 2.5% expected) and 2.5% core (the lowest since April 2021), validating the disinflation trend and reigniting rate cut expectations. By Friday's close, the 10-year had fallen 17 bps on the week to 3.81%, the 2-year dropped 10 bps to 3.40%, and the 30-year declined 16 bps to 4.69%. The 2s10s spread narrowed from +48 bps to +41 bps as the long end rallied more aggressively than the front end.

Fed speakers reinforced a "patient but leaning dovish" posture. Cleveland's Hammack said rates could be on hold for "some time," while Dallas's Logan warned against premature cuts -- but the CPI print shifted market pricing dramatically: CME FedWatch now shows roughly 40% odds of a March cut and 80%+ for June, up from 23% and 55% respectively the prior week. The January jobs report (130K vs. 55K consensus) muddied the picture briefly, but its composition -- heavy healthcare/social assistance, continued federal government losses -- was seen as structurally soft rather than demand-driven strength.

Credit spreads remain historically tight. IG OAS held near 78 bps (2nd percentile over 20 years) while HY OAS was at 292 bps. Record corporate issuance continued -- Alphabet sold $20B in bonds and Morgan Stanley projects $2.3T in total 2026 issuance -- but strong investor demand has absorbed supply without meaningful spread widening.

For our thesis watchlist, the yield decline is unambiguously positive for capital-intensive, high-duration names: grid storage (FLNC, EOSE), pre-revenue developers (QS, LAC, IONQ), and nuclear utilities with long-dated PPAs (CEG, VST). The path to rate cuts is becoming clearer, even if the timing remains uncertain.

## Treasury Yields

| Maturity | Close Feb 13 | Close Feb 6 | Weekly Change (bps) | Note |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|------|
| 2-Year   | 3.40%       | 3.50%       | -10 bps             | Lowest since late 2022; front end lagged the rally |
| 5-Year   | 3.43%       | 3.57%       | -14 bps             | Belly of the curve led the move |
| 10-Year  | 3.81%       | 3.98%       | -17 bps             | Lowest since mid-2025; broke below 4% |
| 30-Year  | 4.69%       | 4.85%       | -16 bps             | Supply concerns offset by CPI-driven demand |

**Intra-week dynamics:** Monday (Feb 9) and Tuesday morning saw yields drift lower ahead of the delayed January jobs report. The NFP release at 8:30 AM Tuesday showed 130K jobs added (vs. 55K consensus), pushing the 2-year up 7 bps intraday to 3.52% and the 10-year to 3.96%. A weak 10-year auction on Tuesday afternoon (bid-to-cover 2.52, below recent averages) added modest upward pressure. Wednesday was choppy. Thursday's CPI release (2.4% YoY headline, 0.2% MoM) triggered the week's largest move -- the 10-year fell 9 bps on the session to 3.87%, and the 2-year dropped 5 bps. Friday continued the rally as markets digested the implications, with the 10-year closing at 3.81% and the 2-year at 3.40%.

## Yield Curve

| Spread        | Feb 13 Level | Feb 6 Level | Weekly Change | Status |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 2s10s Spread  | +41 bps     | +48 bps     | -7 bps        | Positively sloped but flattening |
| 3m10y Spread  | ~-2 bps     | ~+15 bps    | -17 bps       | Turned slightly negative |

The yield curve flattened this week as the long end rallied more than the front end. The 2s10s spread narrowed from +48 bps to +41 bps -- still in positive territory after its historic un-inversion in late 2024, but giving back some of the steepening gained in January. The 3m10y spread turned barely negative as 3-month T-bill yields (anchored near the 3.83% fed funds midpoint) held steady while the 10-year plunged through 3.81%.

The flattening pattern reflects competing forces: the front end is anchored by the Fed's current rate stance (3.50-3.75%) and a jobs report that complicates the case for imminent cuts, while the long end is being pulled lower by the disinflation narrative, growing conviction of an eventual easing cycle, and flight-to-quality demand. This is a textbook bull-flattener -- long duration outperforming as the market prices in an eventual policy pivot.

## Fed Policy & Speakers

### Current Rate: 3.50%-3.75% (held January 28, 2026)

The Fed held rates steady at its January 28 FOMC meeting (10-2 vote, Miran and Waller dissenting in favor of a cut). No FOMC meeting occurred during this reporting week; the next meeting is March 18.

### Fed Speakers This Week

| Speaker | Date | Lean | Key Points |
|---------|------|------|------------|
| **Beth Hammack** (Cleveland) | Feb 10 | Hawkish-hold | Rates could be on hold for "some time"; policy rate already at the right setting; emphasized patience and Fed independence; "strong banks, patient policy" [4] |
| **Lorie Logan** (Dallas) | Feb 10 | Hawkish-hold | Not yet fully confident inflation heading to 2%; warned against premature rate cuts; labor market stabilizing with downside risks diminished; the "easy money phase of the recovery is officially over" [5] |
| **Gov. Stephen Miran** | Prior weeks, resonated this week | Dovish | Previously stated >100 bps of cuts needed in 2026; policy is restraining the economy [6] |

**Assessment:** The week's Fed commentary was split between patient hawks (Hammack, Logan) and dovish dissenters (Miran). Hammack and Logan both argued for an extended hold, emphasizing that inflation progress has stalled around 2.5-2.8% and the labor market is not deteriorating rapidly enough to justify easing. However, the Thursday CPI print (2.4% headline, 2.5% core) undercut some of their caution -- if the next few readings confirm the trend, the patient-hold camp will face growing pressure to act, particularly with Miran already advocating for significant easing.

The net positioning of the Fed remains: hold for now, lean toward easing later in 2026, with the pace determined by data. The CPI print meaningfully strengthened the case for a June cut.

## Rate Expectations -- CME FedWatch

Post-CPI (as of Feb 13 close):

| Meeting | Hold | 25 bps Cut | 50+ bps Cut | Shift vs. Prior Week |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| March 18, 2026 | ~60% | ~38% | ~2% | Cut odds rose from ~23% to ~38% |
| June 2026 | ~20% | ~50% | ~30% | Cut odds surged from ~55% to ~80% |
| Sept 2026 | ~10% | ~35% | ~55% | Two cuts now base case |
| Dec 2026 | ~8% | ~22% | ~70% | Three cuts priced by year-end |

**Full-year 2026 expectations:** The CPI beat significantly shifted the distribution. Markets now price approximately **three rate cuts (75 bps)** by year-end as the base case, up from two cuts the prior week. The probability of a June first cut surged past 80%. March remains a coin-flip -- the strong jobs report argues against, but the CPI trend argues for. The next CPI reading (March 12) and the Feb jobs report (March 6) will be decisive for March pricing.

Gov. Miran's call for >100 bps of cuts is now closer to market pricing than it was a week ago. Vice Chair Bowman's projection of 3 cuts aligns with the new market consensus.

## Credit Markets

### Investment Grade

| Metric | Current Level | Prior Week | Change | Context |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| IG OAS (ICE BofA) | ~78 bps | ~78 bps | Flat | 2nd percentile over 20-year lookback |
| LQD Yield | ~4.35% | ~4.43% | -8 bps | Following Treasuries lower |

IG spreads remained historically tight at approximately 78 bps despite record issuance. The spread compression reflects robust demand for investment-grade credit, driven by all-in yields above 4% attracting institutional allocators. The Breckinridge Q1 2026 outlook notes that while tight spreads limit excess return potential, the carry on IG corporates remains attractive for buy-and-hold portfolios.

### High Yield

| Metric | Current Level | Prior Week | Change | Context |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| HY OAS (ICE BofA) | ~292 bps | ~286 bps | +6 bps | Slight widening, still near long-term mean |
| HYG Yield | ~5.65% | ~5.72% | -7 bps | All-in yield declining with Treasuries |

HY spreads widened modestly (+6 bps) to 292 bps, moving further from the near-historic tights of late 2024 back toward their long-term average. This is orderly normalization rather than stress -- default rates remain contained and the CCC tier is not showing distress signals. The slight widening may reflect rotation into duration (Treasuries) following the CPI beat, rather than credit-specific concerns.

### Notable Issuance

- **Alphabet** sold **$20B** in a seven-part senior unsecured offering (Feb 9) -- one of the largest tech bond deals in history, driven by AI data center capex funding
- **Oracle** disclosed a **$25B** note sale (Feb 2), also tied to AI infrastructure expansion
- **Morgan Stanley** projects total 2026 IG issuance could reach **$2.3 trillion**, driven by AI-related borrowing and $1T+ in refinancing needs
- Global bond sales reached **$1 trillion at record pace** by early February
- The 10-year Treasury auction on Feb 11 saw a **bid-to-cover of 2.52** with the yield coming in at 4.421% -- about half a basis point below expected, suggesting adequate but not exceptional demand

The supply surge is being absorbed cleanly for now, but the tension between record issuance and tight spreads remains the key credit market risk for 2026.

## Key Economic Data

| Data Point | Release Date | Actual | Expected | Prior | Signal |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Nonfarm Payrolls (Jan)** | Feb 11 | +130K | +55K | ~+15K avg 2025 | Beat; best month since Dec 2024 |
| **Unemployment Rate** | Feb 11 | 4.3% | 4.4% | 4.4% | Edged lower |
| **Average Hourly Earnings (MoM)** | Feb 11 | +0.4% | +0.3% | +0.3% | Slightly hot |
| **Average Hourly Earnings (YoY)** | Feb 11 | +3.7% | +3.7% | +3.6% | In line |
| **CPI Headline (YoY)** | Feb 13 | **2.4%** | 2.5% | 2.6% | Beat; lowest since May 2025 |
| **CPI Headline (MoM)** | Feb 13 | **+0.2%** | +0.3% | +0.3% | Beat |
| **CPI Core (YoY)** | Feb 13 | **2.5%** | 2.6% | 2.8% | Beat; **lowest since April 2021** |
| **CPI Core (MoM)** | Feb 13 | **+0.1%** | +0.2% | +0.2% | Significant beat |
| **Shelter CPI (MoM)** | Feb 13 | +0.2% | -- | +0.3% | Slowing; annual at 3.0% |
| **Initial Jobless Claims (wk Feb 7)** | Feb 13 | 227K | 222K | 232K | Slightly elevated but improving |
| **Continuing Claims** | Feb 13 | 1,862K | -- | 1,841K | Rose 21K; winter storm effects |
| **Retail Sales (Jan, MoM)** | NRF Monitor | +0.2% | -- | -- | Fourth consecutive monthly gain |
| **Retail Sales (Jan, YoY)** | NRF Monitor | +5.7% | -- | -- | Solid consumer spending |
| **PPI (Jan)** | Not yet released | -- | -- | +0.5% Dec | Scheduled Feb 27 |

**Jobs report composition:** The +130K headline masked significant sectoral divergence. Healthcare added 82K (ambulatory +50K, hospitals +18K), social assistance +42K, and construction +33K. Federal government lost 34K jobs as deferred resignation offers from 2025 took effect. Financial activities shed 22K. The report was stronger than expected but driven by non-cyclical sectors (healthcare, social assistance) rather than broad-based demand strength.

**CPI deep dive:** The January CPI was the most market-moving data point of the week. Shelter -- the stickiest component -- rose just 0.2% MoM, bringing the annual rate to 3.0% (down from 3.3% the prior month). Energy fell 1.5%. Used cars dropped 1.8%. Food rose a modest 0.2%. Core goods continue deflating while core services (ex-shelter) are decelerating. This is the cleanest disinflation print the Fed has seen in over a year.

## Rate-Sensitive Thesis Tickers

The week's yield decline was broadly positive for rate-sensitive names across our thesis watchlist. Falling rates improve project economics for capital-intensive companies, support higher multiples for high-duration growth stocks, and reduce borrowing costs for leveraged names.

| Ticker | Thesis Sector | Rate Sensitivity | W07 Impact |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **CEG** | Nuclear Energy | 22.6 GW nuclear fleet; 20-yr hyperscaler PPAs at $80-120/MWh; lower rates improve present value of contracted cash flows | Positive: yield decline supports ~31x fwd P/E premium; Calpine acquisition economics improve |
| **VST** | Nuclear Energy | Meta 2.6 GW deal provides 20-yr revenue visibility; lower rates improve project IRRs for uprates and new capacity | Positive: ~14-16x fwd P/E benefits from rate cut expectations; most levered to easing cycle among fleet operators |
| **FLNC** | Energy Storage | $5.5B backlog of grid storage projects; capital-intensive BESS deployment directly benefits from lower financing costs | Strongly positive: IRA standalone storage ITC economics improve further; project payback periods shorten |
| **EOSE** | Energy Storage (LDES) | $303M DOE loan; 35x YoY revenue growth; zinc-based long-duration storage requires significant project financing | Strongly positive: lower rates improve unit economics for LDES projects competing against gas peakers |
| **QS** | Energy Storage (Solid-State) | Pre-revenue; Eagle Line pilot Feb 2026; $5.1B market cap on zero revenue; extreme duration asset | Positive: lower discount rates support speculative valuations; binary outcome still dominates |
| **LAC** | Critical Minerals | Pre-production Thacker Pass; $1.97B DOE loan; GM 38% JV partner; construction-phase capex sensitivity | Positive: lower borrowing costs reduce project financing burden; Thacker Pass IRR improves |
| **IONQ** | Quantum Computing | Pre-revenue quantum hardware; 141x P/S; $106-110M 2025E revenue; extreme long-duration profile | Positive: rate cuts support growth stock multiples; Q4 earnings Feb 25 is next catalyst |
| **PLTR** | Defense / AI | 190x P/E; 56% revenue growth; high-duration profile despite strong profitability | Moderately positive: rate-driven multiple expansion layered on top of fundamental momentum |
| **CRWV** | AI Infrastructure | $863M GAAP loss; heavily leveraged neocloud; 6-yr GPU depreciation on rapidly depreciating hardware | Strongly positive: existential sensitivity to borrowing costs; lower rates extend runway |
| **RUN** | Energy Storage (VPP) | 106K VPP customers; capital-intensive residential solar+storage; rate-sensitive customer economics | Positive: residential solar economics improve with lower financing costs; VPP economics benefit |
| **ALB** | Critical Minerals | Lithium mining capex-intensive; Kings Mountain restart requires significant capital; $19B market cap | Moderately positive: lower rates improve project economics, but lithium price remains primary driver |
| **FCX** | Critical Minerals | Copper mining; Grasberg restart Q2 2026; rate cuts improve commodity demand outlook | Moderately positive: infrastructure spending and copper demand benefit from easing expectations |
| **RKLB** | Space | High-growth but pre-profitability; $1.3B+ SDA contracts; Neutron development is capital-intensive | Moderately positive: growth multiple benefits from lower discount rates |
| **SMR** | Nuclear (SMR) | Pre-revenue; $5B market cap; 6 GW TVA MOU; execution risk is primary driver | Moderately positive: lower rates support speculative multiples, but tech risk dominates |
| **OKLO** | Nuclear (Advanced) | Pre-revenue; $11B market cap; 1.2 GW Meta deal; no construction permit yet | Moderately positive: same dynamic as SMR -- rates matter but execution risk dominates |

**Key observation:** The CPI beat and resulting yield decline created a favorable macro backdrop for nearly every rate-sensitive name in our watchlist. The most leveraged beneficiaries are capital-intensive infrastructure plays (FLNC, EOSE, CRWV) where project-level financing costs directly impact unit economics and viability. Pre-revenue names (QS, IONQ, LAC, OKLO, SMR) benefit from multiple expansion but remain primarily driven by idiosyncratic catalysts. Nuclear utilities (CEG, VST) benefit from the present value of their long-dated contracted cash flows increasing as discount rates fall.

The path to a June rate cut -- now the market's base case -- would further accelerate these dynamics. If confirmed by the next CPI and jobs reports, expect continued rotation into rate-sensitive duration plays.
