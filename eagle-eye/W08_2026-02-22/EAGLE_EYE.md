# Eagle Eye — Week 08 | February 22, 2026

*Weekly Macro Report for the week ending February 20, 2026*

---

## This Week's Take

The week's two dominant events — the January FOMC minutes revealing a sharply divided committee openly discussing rate hikes, and the Supreme Court's landmark 6-3 ruling striking down Trump's IEEPA tariffs — collided with stagflation-flavored data (Q4 GDP 1.4% vs. hot core PCE at 3.0%) to create a market that rallied on the surface but roiled underneath. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to 6,909.51 on what was ultimately a tariff-relief and short-covering rally, with the Nasdaq snapping a five-week losing streak. But the internals tell a more conflicted story: the VIX settled at 19.09 (elevated), institutional SPX put/call hit 1.28 (heavy hedging), and the equity put/call at 0.65 screamed retail complacency — a divergence that often precedes choppy action.

The macro picture is increasingly stagflationary. The GDP miss (1.4% annualized, partially government-shutdown-driven) combined with core PCE re-accelerating to 3.0% puts the Fed in an impossible bind. The FOMC minutes revealed a three-way split — some wanting cuts, others favoring holds, and several explicitly raising hikes — a level of policy uncertainty not seen since 2022. CME FedWatch repriced aggressively: March cut odds collapsed from ~38% to ~6%, and the full-year consensus shifted from three cuts (75 bps) to two (50 bps), with June the earliest plausible move. Dallas Fed President Logan reinforced the cautious stance, warning she is "not fully convinced" inflation is heading to 2%.

The defining rotation of early 2026 — energy over tech, physical economy over digital — continued unabated. Energy leads all sectors at +14% YTD, outpacing the Nasdaq by ~1,200 bps in six weeks. This is not just an oil trade — it reflects the market's recognition that AI infrastructure requires power infrastructure. Gold surged above $5,100/oz on Iran tensions, sovereign debt concerns, and central bank buying, while WTI crude rallied 5.7% to ~$66.30 on the highest US-Iran escalation since 2020. In crypto, the bear market deepened: BTC flat at ~$68,000, ETF outflows hit $3.8B over five weeks, and Fear & Greed touched 8 (Extreme Fear). The week ahead is dominated by NVIDIA earnings (Feb 25) — the single biggest market catalyst of Q1.

- **Rate Expectations:** March hold 94%. June earliest plausible cut. Full-year repriced from 3 cuts to 2 cuts (50 bps). Growing number of traders pricing zero cuts in 2026.
- **2s10s Spread:** +34 bps (bear-steepening). Widest since January 2022.
- **Credit:** IG OAS ~77 bps (2nd percentile over 20 years). HY OAS ~286 bps. No stress signals.

| Feb 28 (Fri) | PCE Price Index (January), Personal Income/Spending | **THE data point** — will Jan PCE confirm or ease the 3.0% core reading |

### Key Earnings
| Company | Ticker | Date | Significance |
|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| **NVIDIA** | NVDA | Feb 25 (after close) | **The single biggest market catalyst of Q1.** $65.6B revenue consensus. Rubin/Blackwell commentary sets AI infrastructure narrative. |

### Fed Speakers & Events
- **March 18 FOMC (SEP meeting with dot plot)** — the next critical inflection point. Updated projections will reveal whether the rate-hike contingency has migrated to formal dots.
- Watch for additional Fed speakers reacting to this week's hot PCE and SCOTUS tariff ruling.

### Thesis Catalysts
- **NVDA earnings (Feb 25):** Binary event for AI infrastructure thesis. Rubin architecture, inference scaling, custom silicon competition all in focus.
- **IONQ earnings (Feb 25):** Quantum thesis validation — revenue trajectory matters more than profitability.
- **RKLB earnings (Feb 26):** Space thesis — SDA contracts, Neutron update, backlog growth.
- **Artemis II launch (March 6):** Potential catalyst for LUNR, RKLB, and the broader lunar/space sector.
- **Bitcoin for Corporations conference (Feb 24-25):** Institutional crypto adoption narrative.
- **January PCE (Feb 28):** If core PCE stays hot (>2.8%), the "higher for longer" narrative solidifies and pressures growth/duration names across all theses.

## Positioning & Thesis Update

### Actionable Takeaways

1. **NVIDIA is the week.** Everything else is noise until Feb 25 after close. A beat + strong Rubin commentary revalidates the AI supercycle and lifts the entire infrastructure chain (AVGO, VRT, ANET, CEG, VST). A miss or cautious guidance could trigger the biggest single-day sector repricing of 2026.

2. **The stagflation signal is real but manageable.** 1.4% GDP + 3.0% core PCE is an ugly combination. But the GDP miss was partially shutdown-driven (private economy grew 2.4%), and the SCOTUS tariff ruling removes a key inflationary pressure. Watch January PCE (Feb 28) — if core eases to 2.7-2.8%, the stagflation scare fades. If it stays hot, defense and energy benefit as the only sectors with earnings growth independent of consumer spending and rate cuts.

3. **Energy rotation is not done.** XLE +14% YTD reflects a structural reprice, not a trade. AI power demand, OPEC+ discipline, and Iran geopolitics all support further outperformance. Nuclear names (CEG, VST, CCJ) are the picks within the theme.

4. **Defense supercycle is confirmed by numbers, not just narrative.** Combined backlogs exceed $800B. AVAV (+62% YTD) and KTOS (+72% YTD) are moving like tech stocks on drone/autonomous warfare demand. Pentagon review is a buying opportunity, not a structural risk.

5. **SCOTUS tariff ruling cuts both ways.** Short-term positive (reduced inflation, consumer relief), but Trump's immediate 10% global tariff replacement limits the upside. Watch for administration attempts to find alternative legal authority. Importers and ecommerce (ETSY, AMZN) are near-term beneficiaries.

6. **Crypto is in capitulation territory.** Fear & Greed at 8, spot volumes -59%, negative funding rates, and $314B in stablecoin dry powder are textbook bottoming indicators. But ETF outflows of $3.8B over 5 weeks with no reversal signal means the floor hasn't been confirmed. The $65,600 BTC support level is the line in the sand.

7. **Rate-sensitive positioning adjustment.** March cut odds at 6% (from 38% last week) means rate-cut-dependent theses need patience. Pre-revenue quantum names (IONQ, QBTS, RGTI) and leveraged neoclouds face continued multiple compression. Contracted-revenue infrastructure plays (CEG, VST, LMT, RTX) are insulated by backlogs and PPAs.
