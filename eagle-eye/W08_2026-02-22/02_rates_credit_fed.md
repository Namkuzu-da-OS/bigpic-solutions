# Rates, Credit & Fed -- Week Ending 2026-02-20

## Summary

The dominant story this week was the January FOMC minutes, released Wednesday Feb 18, which revealed a sharply divided committee with several officials explicitly raising the possibility of rate hikes if inflation remains elevated. The hawkish tone reversed the prior week's post-CPI rally: Treasury yields climbed across the curve, with the 10-year rising 4 bps on the week to 4.08% (from 4.04%), the 2-year gaining 1 bp to 3.74%, and the 30-year adding 3 bps to 4.72%. Strong economic data reinforced the selloff -- initial jobless claims plunged to 206,000 (lowest since January 10), industrial production jumped 0.7%, and housing starts rose 6.2% -- painting a picture of an economy that needs no rate relief.

CME FedWatch now prices a 94% probability of a hold at the March 18 meeting, with only a 6% chance of a cut. The market has meaningfully repriced from last week's post-CPI euphoria: March cut odds collapsed from ~38% to ~6%, and the full-year consensus has shifted from three cuts (75 bps) to approximately two cuts (50 bps), with June the earliest plausible first move. Dallas Fed President Logan reinforced the cautious stance, warning that tariffs "still need to fully work their way through prices" and expressing doubt that inflation is on a clear path to 2%.

Credit spreads remain near historic tights. IG OAS held at ~77 bps (2nd percentile over 20 years) and HY OAS was at ~286 bps. The ON RRP facility has effectively been drained to near-zero, and the TGA balance sits around $949B -- both liquidity indicators that matter more for plumbing than for directional rates positioning, but worth monitoring as the Fed continues QT.

For our thesis watchlist, this week's yield backup is a modest headwind for duration-sensitive names but does not change the structural picture. The hawkish repricing is a reality check on timing, not a reversal of the easing trajectory -- the Fed is still at 3.50-3.75%, and most FOMC participants still lean toward eventual cuts, not hikes.

## Treasury Yields

| Maturity | Close Feb 20 | Close Feb 13 | Weekly Change (bps) | Note |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|------|
| 2-Year   | 3.74%       | 3.73%       | +1 bp               | Front end barely moved; anchored by Fed hold expectations |
| 5-Year   | 3.69%       | 3.68%       | +1 bp               | Belly of the curve similarly range-bound |
| 10-Year  | 4.08%       | 4.04%       | +4 bps              | FOMC minutes + strong data pushed through 4.10% intraday |
| 30-Year  | 4.72%       | 4.69%       | +3 bps              | Long end sold off on rate-hike scenario mention |

**Intra-week dynamics:** Tuesday (Feb 17, first day back after Presidents' Day) was quiet with the 10-year little changed at 4.06%. Wednesday's FOMC minutes release (2:00 PM ET) was the inflection point -- the revelation that several officials had discussed rate hikes pushed the 10-year from 4.06% to 4.09% on the session. Thursday continued the grind higher as initial jobless claims (206K vs. 223K expected) and strong industrial production data reinforced the hawkish narrative, with the 10-year touching 4.10%. Friday saw modest consolidation, with the 10-year settling at 4.08% and the 30-year reaching 4.72%.

## Yield Curve

| Spread        | Feb 20 Level | Feb 13 Level | Weekly Change | Status |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 2s10s Spread  | +34 bps     | +31 bps     | +3 bps        | Positively sloped; bear-steepening |
| 3m10y Spread  | ~+40 bps    | ~-2 bps     | +42 bps       | Sharply positive; 3m rate dropped on T-bill rollover dynamics |

The 2s10s spread widened modestly from +31 to +34 bps as the long end sold off more than the front end -- a mild bear-steepener. The 3m10y spread, which turned slightly negative the prior week, swung sharply positive to approximately +40 bps. This reflects the unusual combination of T-bill rates anchored well below the fed funds midpoint (3.625%) due to debt ceiling dynamics and heavy short-end demand, while the 10-year repriced higher on hawkish Fed signals.

The yield curve remains in a normal upward-sloping posture after its historic un-inversion in late 2024, but the shape is signaling competing forces: the front end is constrained by the Fed's hold stance and debt ceiling dynamics, while the long end is being repriced by the re-emergence of inflation risk and potential rate-hike scenarios. The widest 2s10s spread since January 2022 (referenced by Seeking Alpha) underscores how far the curve has traveled from its deeply inverted 2022-2024 regime.

## Fed Watch

### Current Rate: 3.50%-3.75% (held January 28, 2026)

No FOMC meeting occurred during this reporting week. The next meeting is March 17-18 (SEP meeting with dot plot and economic projections).

### FOMC Minutes -- January 27-28 Meeting (Released Feb 18)

The January minutes were the week's most consequential event. Key takeaways:

- **Rate-hike scenario explicitly discussed.** Several officials wanted the post-meeting statement to include "a two-sided description of the Committee's future interest rate decisions," reflecting the possibility that upward adjustments could be appropriate if inflation remains above target. Bloomberg headlined this as officials "pointing to rate-hike scenario."
- **Hawkish pause characterization.** While most members supported the hold at 3.50-3.75%, the minutes revealed deep division: some participants argued for future cuts, others for holding steady, and a third group argued rates may need to rise. This three-way split is unusual and signals genuine policy uncertainty.
- **Inflation concerns dominant.** Most participants cautioned that progress toward 2% might be "slower and more uneven than generally expected" and judged the risk of inflation running persistently above target as "meaningful."
- **AI productivity mentioned.** Several participants highlighted that massive AI investment is driving a "productivity miracle" that could allow 2.2% GDP growth without necessarily stoking inflation -- a potential dovish offset to the inflation concerns.
- **10-2 dissent.** Governors Waller and Miran voted against the hold, preferring further cuts. Miran has previously stated that >100 bps of cuts are needed in 2026.

### Fed Speakers This Week

| Speaker | Date | Lean | Key Points |
|---------|------|------|------------|
| **Gov. Michael Barr** | Feb 17 | Neutral | Speech on AI and the labor market at NYABE; focused on structural economic transformation rather than near-term policy |
| **Lorie Logan** (Dallas) | Feb 20 | Hawkish-hold | Policy "well positioned" but she is "not fully convinced" inflation is on a path to 2%; tariffs still working through the system; Supreme Court tariff decision adds new uncertainty; "cautiously optimistic" overall [9] |
| **Michelle Bowman** (Vice Chair for Supervision) | Feb 16, 19 | Regulatory-focused | Banking outlook: proposed easing mortgage capital rules (remove MSA deduction, use LTV-based risk weights); modernizing large-bank capital framework (stress testing, SLR, Basel III, G-SIB surcharge); comprehensive review of MRAs [10] |

**Assessment:** Logan's Friday speech was the most policy-relevant -- her explicit doubt about the inflation path to 2% and emphasis on tariff passthrough reinforce the minutes' hawkish tone. Bowman's remarks were regulatory rather than monetary policy, but her proposed loosening of bank mortgage capital rules signals a supervisory pivot toward facilitating credit availability. Barr's AI remarks offered an intellectual framework (AI as productivity-enhancing, potentially non-inflationary) that aligns with the minutes' productivity miracle commentary.

### Rate Expectations -- CME FedWatch

Post-minutes/data (as of Feb 20 close):

| Meeting | Hold | 25 bps Cut | 50+ bps Cut | Shift vs. Prior Week |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| March 18, 2026 | ~94% | ~6% | <1% | Cut odds collapsed from ~38% to ~6% |
| May 2026 | ~80% | ~18% | ~2% | Modest cut odds, but hold is strong consensus |
| June 2026 | ~55% | ~42% | ~3% | June remains earliest plausible cut date |
| Dec 2026 | ~20% | ~35% | ~45% | Two cuts by year-end is revised base case |

**Full-year 2026 expectations:** Markets have repriced from three cuts (75 bps) to approximately two cuts (50 bps) by year-end. The hawkish minutes and strong data combined to push the first likely cut from June to June-at-earliest, with meaningful risk it slips to the second half of the year. The rate-hike scenario discussed in the minutes is not priced as a base case but has injected a tail risk that was absent from market pricing the prior week.

The growing number of options traders seeing no Fed cuts in 2026 at all (per Yahoo Finance) is a sentiment shift worth monitoring. If the next CPI and jobs reports confirm a sticky-inflation / strong-labor picture, the "higher for longer" narrative could become the dominant positioning.

## Credit Markets

### Investment Grade

| Metric | Current Level | Prior Week | Change | Context |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| IG OAS (ICE BofA) | ~77 bps | ~78 bps | -1 bp | 2nd percentile over 20-year lookback |
| IG All-in Yield | ~4.85% | ~4.82% | +3 bps | Following Treasuries higher |

IG spreads remain near multi-decade tights at approximately 77 bps. The Breckinridge Q1 2026 outlook notes that spreads ended 2025 at 78 bps (2nd percentile over a 20-year lookback), and they have barely budged since. Tight credit spreads, solid demand, stable fundamentals, and tariff-related uncertainty are the competing factors. The risk is that at these compressed levels, any economic deterioration would drive outsized spread widening since there is very little cushion priced in.

### High Yield

| Metric | Current Level | Prior Week | Change | Context |
|--------|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| HY OAS (ICE BofA) | ~286 bps | ~292 bps | -6 bps | Tightened modestly; below long-term average |
| HY B-rated OAS | ~314 bps | ~320 bps (est.) | -6 bps | Single-B tighter as risk appetite holds |

HY spreads tightened modestly to ~286 bps despite the hawkish Fed repricing. This apparent contradiction reflects two dynamics: (1) strong economic data is actually positive for credit quality even if it delays rate cuts, and (2) the carry trade at all-in HY yields above 7% continues to attract institutional demand. Default rates remain contained. No stress signals from the CCC tier.

### Bank Lending Conditions

The January 2026 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) -- the most recent release -- showed mixed signals:

- **C&I lending:** Standards tightened for firms of all sizes, but demand strengthened for large/middle-market firms and was unchanged for small firms.
- **CRE lending:** Standards generally unchanged; demand strengthened.
- **Consumer/mortgage:** Standards unchanged; demand weakened.
- **2026 outlook:** Banks expect standards to remain broadly unchanged and demand to strengthen across all categories.
- **AI impact:** A moderate net share of banks reported higher likelihood of approving C&I loans to firms benefiting from AI, while a major net share reported being less likely to approve loans to firms adversely affected by AI -- a notable differentiation by technology adoption.

Vice Chair Bowman's proposed mortgage capital rule changes (removing MSA deduction, LTV-based risk weights) could gradually reverse the long-term decline in banks' mortgage origination share from 60% in 2008 to 35% in 2023.

## Liquidity

### Treasury General Account (TGA)

| Metric | Level | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| TGA Balance | ~$949B (as of Feb 10) | Elevated; providing fiscal cushion |

The TGA balance remains elevated near $949B, well above the operating minimum. This large cash buffer gives the Treasury flexibility to manage debt ceiling constraints (if they become binding) and reduces the need for emergency bill issuance that could drain reserves. For markets, a high TGA is modestly restrictive -- funds sitting at the Fed are not in the banking system.

### Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP)

| Metric | Level | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ON RRP Usage | ~$10-20B (near zero) | Effectively drained; no longer a meaningful liquidity buffer |

The ON RRP facility -- once absorbing over $2.5 trillion at its peak in late 2022 -- has been effectively drained to near-zero. This is the most consequential liquidity development of the past year: with the RRP buffer exhausted, any additional pressure on cash markets falls directly on bank reserves. The Fed acknowledged in the September 2025 FOMC minutes that ON RRP balances "could no longer serve as a meaningful buffer for reserve fluctuations."

The practical implication is increased vulnerability to short-term funding stress at quarter-end, month-end, and during heavy Treasury issuance windows. The year-end 2025 episode -- when the Fed's Standing Repo Facility (SRF) spiked to $75B before collapsing back to zero in January 2026 -- illustrated how quickly plumbing stress can emerge. For now, reserves are adequate (~$3.2T), but the margin of safety is narrower than at any point since QT began.

### QT Status

The Fed continues balance sheet runoff at the reduced pace of $25B/month in Treasuries and $35B/month in MBS (reduced from $60B/$35B in June 2024). At the current pace, the balance sheet is declining by approximately $720B/year. Most analysts expect QT to end in mid-to-late 2026, with the Fed watching reserve levels and funding market indicators for signals to stop.

## Key Economic Data

| Data Point | Release Date | Actual | Expected | Prior | Signal |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Housing Starts (Dec)** | Feb 18 | 1.404M SAAR (+6.2%) | 1.33M | 1.322M | Beat; strongest since February 2025 |
| **Industrial Production (Jan)** | Feb 18 | +0.7% | +0.3% est. | +0.2% | Beat; manufacturing output +0.6% |
| **Capacity Utilization (Jan)** | Feb 18 | 76.2% | ~76.0% | ~75.6% | Rose but still 3.2 pts below long-run avg |
| **Initial Jobless Claims (wk Feb 14)** | Feb 19 | **206K** | 223K | 229K (revised) | Big beat; lowest since Jan 10; fell 23K |
| **Continuing Claims (wk Feb 7)** | Feb 19 | 1.870M | -- | 1.853M | Rose 17K; modestly elevated |
| **Building Permits (Dec)** | Feb 18 | Rose | -- | -- | Positive but mixed with LEI softness |
| **Leading Economic Index (Jan)** | Feb 19 | Declined | -- | -- | Conference Board finds more economic softness |

The data week was unambiguously strong on the activity/labor side: industrial production beat handily, housing starts surprised to the upside, and the plunge in initial claims to 206K signaled that layoffs remain near historic lows despite DOGE-related federal government reductions. The contrast with the Conference Board's LEI decline (its 24th decline in 26 months) underscores the persistent divergence between coincident/lagging strength and forward-looking weakness.

## Rate-Sensitive Thesis Tickers

The week's modest yield backup (+4 bps on the 10-year) and hawkish repricing (March cut odds: 38% to 6%) represent a minor headwind to duration-sensitive watchlist names, but the moves were small relative to the prior week's CPI-driven rally. The key takeaway is that the rate-cutting timeline has been pushed out, not cancelled -- the structural case for eventual easing remains intact.

| Ticker | Thesis Sector | Rate Sensitivity | W08 Impact |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **CEG** | Nuclear Energy | 22.6 GW fleet; long-dated hyperscaler PPAs | Minimal: +4 bps 10Y is noise against $80-120/MWh contracted margins |
| **VST** | Nuclear Energy | Meta 2.6 GW deal; 20-yr revenue visibility | Minimal: ~14-16x fwd P/E insulated by earnings growth guidance of 73-93% |
| **FLNC** | Energy Storage | $5.5B backlog; capital-intensive grid BESS deployment | Slight headwind: project economics modestly less favorable but IRA ITC offsets |
| **EOSE** | Energy Storage (LDES) | $303M DOE loan; zinc-based LDES requires project financing | Slight headwind: higher project financing costs, but DOE loan rate is fixed |
| **IONQ** | Quantum Computing | 141x P/S; Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 25 | Moderate headwind: growth multiples compress when rate cuts are delayed |
| **PLTR** | Defense / AI | 190x P/E; 56% revenue growth; guided $7.2B FY2026 | Moderate headwind: valuation premium sensitive to discount rate expectations |
| **CRWV** | AI Infrastructure | $863M GAAP loss; heavily leveraged neocloud | Meaningful headwind: borrowing costs stay elevated longer; existential rate sensitivity |
| **LAC** | Critical Minerals | Pre-production; $1.97B DOE loan; construction phase | Slight headwind: project IRR somewhat lower, but DOE loan terms are fixed |
| **ALB** | Critical Minerals | Lithium mining; Kings Mountain restart capex | Neutral: lithium price ($20K+/t recovery) is the primary driver, not rates |
| **FCX** | Critical Minerals | Copper; Grasberg restart Q2 2026 | Neutral: strong economy actually supports copper demand fundamentals |
| **MP** | Critical Minerals | Mine-to-magnet; $400M DOD equity | Neutral: DOD funding is rate-insensitive; execution is the variable |
| **RKLB** | Space | SDA contracts; Neutron development | Slight headwind: growth stock valuation sensitive to rate expectations |

**Key observation:** The hawkish repricing is a timing adjustment, not a regime change. The Fed is still at 3.50-3.75% -- well below the 2023 peak of 5.25-5.50% -- and the dominant FOMC view is still that the next move is eventually a cut, not a hike, despite the minutes' two-sided language. For capital-intensive infrastructure plays (FLNC, EOSE, CRWV), the delay in rate cuts extends the period of elevated financing costs. For pre-revenue speculative names (IONQ, QS, OKLO, SMR), multiple compression risk increases as the discount rate stays higher for longer. For companies with contracted revenues and government-backed financing (CEG, VST, LAC, MP), the impact is minimal.

The March 18 FOMC meeting (SEP meeting with dot plot) is the next critical inflection point. The updated dot plot will reveal whether the rate-hike contingency discussed in the minutes has migrated from informal conversation to formal projections.
