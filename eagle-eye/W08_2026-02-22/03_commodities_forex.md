# Commodities & Forex — Week Ending 2026-02-20

## Summary

Commodities and forex markets this week were dominated by two seismic events: escalating US-Iran military tensions that sent oil prices surging to six-month highs and gold above $5,100/oz, and the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling striking down Trump's IEEPA-based tariffs (6-3 decision on Feb 20), which hammered the DXY below 97.75 and triggered a broad dollar sell-off. WTI crude rallied 5.7% on the week as President Trump signaled a potential military strike on Iran within 10 days, while a massive 9.0M barrel EIA inventory draw reinforced the bullish supply narrative. Gold printed a new weekly close above $5,100 on safe-haven demand, sovereign debt concerns, and central bank buying. Copper pulled back to ~$5.90/lb amid post-Lunar New Year demand sluggishness in China, but structural deficit projections (330,000-450,000 MT in 2026) keep the medium-term outlook bullish. Natural gas futures slipped below $3.00/MMBtu for the first time since mid-October as mild weather forecasts overpowered the residual support from Winter Storm Fern's record storage drawdowns. The Supreme Court tariff ruling was the week's defining macro event for FX, removing a key inflationary pressure and weakening the dollar's yield advantage.

## Energy

| Commodity | Close (Feb 20) | Weekly % | Driver |
|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| WTI Crude | ~$66.70/bbl | +5.7% | US-Iran military threat; 9.0M bbl EIA inventory draw |
| Brent Crude | ~$71.30/bbl | +5.0%+ | Strait of Hormuz risk premium; first close above $70 in 2+ weeks |
| Natural Gas (Henry Hub) | ~$3.00/MMBtu | -6.5% | Mild weather outlook; storage normalizing post-Winter Storm Fern |

**Crude Oil:**
- WTI and Brent posted their first weekly gains in three weeks, rallying approximately 5-6% as US-Iran tensions escalated sharply. President Trump stated on Thursday that he would decide within 10 days whether to launch military strikes against Iran, sending crude to its highest levels since early August. [1][2]
- The geopolitical risk premium is estimated at $7-10/bbl. Roughly 20 million barrels of oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz daily -- about 20% of global oil consumption. Iran's IRGC conducted military drills in the strait this week, and Reuters reports 166-170 million barrels of Iranian crude sit on floating tankers, primarily near Singapore and Malaysia. [3][4]
- The EIA weekly petroleum status report (released Feb 19 for the week ending Feb 13) showed a massive 9.0 million barrel drawdown in commercial crude stocks to 419.8 million barrels -- a stark reversal from the prior week's 8.5 million barrel build. Inventories are now approximately 5% below the five-year average. Refinery utilization climbed to 91.0%, with crude inputs averaging 16.1M bpd (+77K bpd WoW). Crude imports fell 281K bpd to 6.5M bpd. [5]
- OPEC+ context: Eight key producers continue their production pause through Q1 2026, keeping 2.9 million bpd of voluntary cuts off the market. Four producers (UAE, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman) deepened compensation cuts to 829,000 bpd through June -- three times their previous pledge. Despite last week's reports that OPEC+ was considering an April production increase, the current stance remains restrictive. [6][7]

**Natural Gas:**
- Henry Hub prompt-month futures slipped below $3.00/MMBtu support for the first time since mid-October. Month-to-date through Feb 18, settlements averaged $3.23/MMBtu within a tight $3.01-$3.51 range. [8]
- The dramatic decline from late January's Winter Storm Fern spike (spot prices hit an all-time high of $30.72/MMBtu on Jan 23) has fully normalized. The storm triggered a record 360 Bcf weekly withdrawal from storage (week ending Jan 30), leaving inventories 5.6% below the five-year average. [9]
- The EIA raised its 2026 Henry Hub forecast to $4.31/MMBtu (up ~25% from the January forecast), driven by lower post-storm storage levels. However, mild February weather and moderating demand are pressuring near-term prices. LNG export flows provide support but are insufficient to offset the seasonal headwind. [10]

## Precious Metals

| Metal | Close (Feb 20-21) | Weekly % | Note |
|-------|-------------------|----------|------|
| Gold | ~$5,107/oz | +2.5%+ | New weekly close above $5,100; Iran tensions + SCOTUS tariff ruling |
| Silver | ~$80-85/oz | +1-2% | Recovering from Jan crash; safe-haven bid supporting |

**Gold:**
- Gold punched above $5,100/oz for the week, closing Friday (Feb 20) at ~$5,062 (+$64.60, +1.29% on the day) before extending to $5,107 by Saturday's reference price. The metal is consolidating near record territory after breaching $5,000 in late January and touching $5,595 intraday on Jan 29. [11][12]
- Multiple structural tailwinds are converging: (1) escalating US-Iran tensions driving safe-haven flows, (2) the "Sovereign Debt Maturity Apex" -- record government debt issued in the low-rate 2020-2021 window is now maturing into a high-rate environment, (3) central bank buying that remains elevated at an estimated 755 tonnes for 2026 (below 2024's 1,045 tonnes but well above pre-2022 averages of 400-500 tonnes), and (4) a weakening US dollar after the Supreme Court tariff ruling. [13][14]
- J.P. Morgan continues to see structural support for gold, with the metal up approximately 18% year-to-date. Gold ETF inflows have returned to crisis-era highs. Mine supply growth of only 1-2% annually constrains the supply side. [15]

**Silver:**
- Silver stabilized in the $80-85/oz range, recovering from the violent January crash that saw it plunge from a record $121 (Jan 29) after exchange margin hikes triggered forced liquidations. Silver remains down roughly 30% from those highs but is up substantially year-to-date. [16]
- UBS maintains a $100/oz target for silver, citing industrial demand from solar panel manufacturing and safe-haven overlap with gold. The gold-silver ratio remains elevated, suggesting silver has room to outperform if precious metals momentum continues.

## Industrial & Critical Minerals

| Commodity | Level (Feb 20) | Move | Note |
|-----------|----------------|------|------|
| Copper (LME) | ~$12,710/t (~$5.77/lb) | -3-4% from Jan highs | Post-Lunar New Year China demand lull; structural deficit intact |
| Uranium (U3O8 spot) | ~$92/lb | -2.5% from $94.28 Jan close | Pullback from near 2-year highs; supply-demand deficit structural |

**Copper:**
- LME copper traded at approximately $12,710/tonne ($5.77/lb) as of February 20, pulling back from its dramatic all-time high of $14,527.50/t set on January 29 (though that record level was short-lived, closing the day at $13,720.50/t). [17]
- Chinese demand softened as manufacturers paused operations ahead of and following the extended Lunar New Year holidays. Industrial activity in China -- the world's top copper consumer -- slowed measurably in mid-February. [18]
- Supply side fundamentals remain structurally bullish. Multiple forecasters project a deficit in 2026: UBS sees 407,000 tonnes, J.P. Morgan estimates 330,000 MT, and GF Futures/Citic Securities warn of up to 450,000 tonnes. Major mines continue to face power outage challenges. [19]
- Freeport-McMoRan's phased Grasberg restart in Q2 2026 remains the key near-term supply catalyst. Goldman Sachs projects the LME copper price to average $10,710/t in H1 2026, rising to $12,500/t in Q2 as supply disruptions persist. [20]

**Uranium:**
- Uranium futures pulled back to ~$92/lb from the near two-year high of $101.5, as a fresh increase in global supply momentarily outweighed robust demand expectations. Cameco's end-of-January reference spot price was $94.28/lb -- the highest since February 2024. [21][22]
- Kazatomprom, the world's largest uranium producer (40% of global output), announced plans to lower 2026 production to 29,697 tonnes -- down from 32,777 tonnes -- despite firm long-term prices. This production discipline continues to tighten the structural supply deficit, which is estimated at 30-40 million lbs annually. [23]
- Demand side drivers remain powerful: the nuclear renaissance for AI data center power (10+ GW of hyperscaler nuclear commitments), 63-68 reactors under construction globally, and the US ban on Russian enriched uranium effective 2028 all underpin long-term price support. The NexGen Energy CNSC Rook I hearing concluded in February, with a ruling pending (120-day service standard). [24]

## Agricultural Commodities

| Commodity | Level (approx.) | Notable Move | Driver |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| Wheat | ~$5.50/bu | +10% from lows | Southern Plains weather concerns; USDA raised farm gate price $0.10 to $5.00/bu |
| Corn | ~$4.25-4.30/bu | Range-bound | 22 of 24 sessions between $4.25-$4.30; USDA raised price $0.10 to $4.20/bu |
| Soybeans | ~$11.22/bu | +1.75-2.0% | Trump social media post reignited China buying hopes; March futures +$0.1175 to $11.225 |

**Key developments:**
- The USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum (Feb 19) provided updated projections: farm gate prices were raised by a dime across the board -- corn to $4.20/bu, soybeans to $10.30/bu, wheat to $5.00/bu. Acreage shifts are expected as farmers respond to relative profitability. [25]
- Soybeans saw the most notable intra-week move. On Feb 5, Trump reignited hopes for major Chinese soybean purchases through a social media post, sending March futures up 1.75-2.0% (+$0.1175 to $11.225). The move reflects how headline-driven the soybean market has become amid ongoing trade policy uncertainty. [26]
- Wheat has rallied more than 10% off its lows in the last two months, driven by weather concerns in the Southern Plains, biofuel sector demand, and geopolitical factors including Russian export logistics. [27]
- Corn remains range-bound, with March corn trading between $4.25 and $4.30 in 22 of the last 24 sessions. Demand remains stable but absent a strong catalyst for a breakout. [28]

## Forex

| Pair | Level (Feb 20) | Weekly % | Driver |
|------|----------------|----------|--------|
| DXY | ~97.75 | -0.3% | SCOTUS tariff ruling collapsed late-week gains; GDP miss at 1.4% |
| EUR/USD | 1.1785 | +0.1% | Dollar weakness post-SCOTUS; euro maintaining strength near 1.18 |
| USD/JPY | 154.95 | +1.5% | Yen weakness despite risk-off; BOJ rate path uncertainty |
| GBP/USD | 1.3473 | +0.1% | Modest gains; pound supported by broad dollar weakness |

**Key themes:**

- **Supreme Court tariff ruling (Feb 20):** The defining FX event of the week. In a 6-3 decision (*Learning Resources Inc. v. Trump*), the Court ruled that "IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs," striking down the "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs and the 25% IEEPA-based duties on Canada, China, and Mexico. Section 232 tariffs remain in force. The ruling invalidates tariffs that had generated $160 billion in revenue and were projected to raise $1.4 trillion over the next decade. DXY immediately dropped below 97.75 on the news, as the removal of IEEPA tariffs reduces a key structural inflationary pressure, theoretically giving the Fed more room to cut rates. However, the market had partially priced this in -- JPMorgan had assigned a 64% probability to the tariffs being struck down. [29][30][31]

- **US GDP Q4 2025:** GDP grew at just 1.4% annualized, well below the 3% consensus forecast. The shortfall was largely driven by the 43-day government shutdown, which hammered federal spending by 16.6%, subtracting roughly 1.15 percentage points from growth. This disappointing print contributed to the late-week dollar weakness. [32]

- **DXY** was tracking for a ~1% weekly gain through Thursday, supported by FOMC minutes showing some policymakers remain open to further rate hikes if inflation persists. The Supreme Court ruling and weak GDP data reversed those gains, closing near 97.75. The index is now down substantially from 2025 highs and hovering near levels not seen since mid-2021. [33]

- **EUR/USD** held near 1.1785, maintaining its position after briefly breaching 1.2000 earlier in 2026 (the first time since June 2021). Continued ECB rate holds and dollar weakness support the pair. The Supreme Court ruling adds incremental euro support by reducing USD yield advantage. [34]

- **USD/JPY** was the outlier this week, rising to 154.95 despite broad dollar weakness elsewhere. The yen weakened as markets recalibrated BOJ tightening expectations and Treasury Secretary Bessent's comments provided support. However, the 155-159 range remains sensitive to intervention threats from Japanese authorities. [35]

- **GBP/USD** edged higher to 1.3473, with the pound displaying continued bullish momentum. Key support levels held, and broad dollar selling post-SCOTUS provided incremental lift. [36]

## Supply Chain & Trade

**Baltic Dry Index:** The BDI eased to 2,019 on Feb 19 (-2.5% from last week's 2,063-2,100 range), declining for a second consecutive session amid lower seasonal demand linked to the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday lull. Capesize rates remain the primary drag as iron ore shipping demand softens. [37]

**Trade policy (landmark week):**
- The Supreme Court's IEEPA tariff ruling on Feb 20 is the most significant trade policy event of 2026. While Section 232 tariffs (steel, aluminum, autos) remain intact, the effective average tariff rate on all imports drops materially. The average household tax increase from tariffs falls from ~$1,000 (2025) to ~$400 (2026). The administration has signaled it may pursue alternative legal authority to reimpose tariffs. [29][30]
- The ruling has major implications for commodity markets: reduced tariff barriers lower input costs for US manufacturers (bullish for copper and metals demand), reduce inflation expectations (dovish for Fed, bullish for gold), and remove a key source of trade friction with Canada, China, and Mexico. [31]
