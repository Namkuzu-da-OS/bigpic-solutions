# Equities & Sectors -- Week Ending February 20, 2026

*Eagle Eye Weekly Report | W08 2026-02-22*

---

## Market Overview

Markets rallied on the week, snapping a two-week losing streak, as the Supreme Court delivered a landmark ruling striking down President Trump's emergency tariffs and weak Q4 GDP data paradoxically fed hopes for eventual rate relief. The week was bookended by two headline events: **Palo Alto Networks' earnings miss on Monday** (shares dropped ~7% on guidance) and the **Supreme Court's 6-3 IEEPA tariff ruling on Friday**, which sent stocks surging into the close. Markets then gave back some gains in after-hours trading as Trump announced a replacement 10% "global tariff" via executive order.

### Weekly Index Performance

| Index | Friday Close (Feb 20) | Weekly Change | YTD |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|-----|
| **S&P 500** | 6,909.51 | **+1.1%** | ~+1.5% |
| **Nasdaq Composite** | 22,886.07 | **+1.5%** | Snapped 5-week losing streak |
| **Dow Jones Industrial Average** | 49,625.97 | **+0.3%** | Positive |
| **Russell 2000** | 2,663.78 | **-0.05% (Fri)** | Outperforming SPX YTD |

*Note: Markets were closed Monday Feb 17 for Presidents' Day; this was a 4-day trading week. Prior week close (Feb 13): SPX 6,836.17 (-1.4% that week).*

**Key context:** The S&P 500 reclaimed its 50-day moving average (6,895) on Friday after trading below it for much of the week. Mega-cap tech stabilized rather than dragging, and cyclicals participated in the rally. The Nasdaq's +1.5% gain snapped a five-week losing streak that had been driven by rotation out of AI/tech and into energy, financials, and defense.

### Macro Data Released This Week

| Data Point | Result | Expectation | Significance |
|------------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Q4 2025 GDP (advance)** | **1.4% annualized** | 2.9% (consensus) | Sharp miss; govt shutdown subtracted ~1.0pp; private economy grew 2.4% |
| **December PCE Price Index** | **+0.4% MoM, 2.9% YoY** | 2.8% YoY | Largest monthly jump since Feb 2025 |
| **Core PCE** | **3.0% YoY** | 2.9% | Fed's preferred gauge; re-accelerating |
| **Full Year 2025 GDP** | **2.2%** | -- | Down from 2.8% in 2024 |

**Fed implications:** The probability of a March rate cut dropped to 5% (from 10% prior week). April eased to 18% (from 30%). June now stands at 57% (down from 85%). The hot PCE print reinforces the "higher for longer" narrative despite the weak GDP headline. Fed Funds remain at 3.50-3.75%.

---

## Sector Performance

The dominant sector rotation of early 2026 continued this week: **energy leading, tech lagging** relative to history, though tech bounced this week.

### YTD Sector Leaders & Laggards (through Feb 20)

| Sector | YTD Performance | Weekly Trend | Commentary |
|--------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Energy (XLE)** | **+14%+ YTD** (sector leader) | Strong | "Tectonic shift" -- outpacing Nasdaq by ~1,200 bps in 6 weeks. Stabilized oil + AI power demand thesis |
| **Financials (XLF)** | Outperforming | Positive | Benefits from elevated rates; bank earnings beats; Q4 money center results strong |
| **Industrials (XLI)** | Outperforming | Positive | Defense stocks and infrastructure names leading |
| **Health Care (XLV)** | Mixed | Positive surprise in earnings | EPS beats led by health care sector |
| **Technology (XLK)** | Underperforming (recovering) | **+1.5% this week** | Bounced after 5-week losing streak; all eyes on NVDA earnings Feb 25 |
| **Communication Services (XLC)** | Mixed | Positive | Benefiting from earnings surprises |
| **Consumer Discretionary (XLY)** | Mixed | Tariff-sensitive; rallied Friday | Supreme Court ruling boosted ecommerce names (ETSY +8.4%, AMZN, EBAY) |
| **Consumer Staples (XLP)** | Defensive | WMT guidance miss weighed | Walmart -3% on cautious FY2027 outlook |
| **Utilities (XLU)** | Positive | Nuclear/power demand tailwind | CEG, VST benefiting from data center power narrative |
| **Real Estate (XLRE)** | Lagging | Rate-sensitive | Higher-for-longer rates a headwind |
| **Materials (XLB)** | Moderate | Copper/lithium sentiment improving | Supply deficit narratives supporting names |

**Key sector rotation dynamic:** The Energy sector has surged to become the undisputed leader in 2026, posting 14%+ gains in just six weeks vs. ~1.5% for the S&P 500. Capital is rotating out of technology into energy and physical-economy sectors. This aligns with the AI infrastructure power demand thesis -- investors are positioning in the companies that supply electricity to data centers rather than the data centers themselves.

## Breadth & Sentiment

### Market Breadth

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **S&P 500 stocks above 200-day MA** | **67.8%** (as of Feb 18) | Neutral; 56th percentile historically |
| **S&P 500 stocks above 50-day MA** | **66.8%** (as of Feb 18) | Cooling from >73% in mid-January |
| **S&P 500 vs. 50-day MA** | Trading at/near 50-DMA (6,895) | Reclaimed on Friday; key technical level |
| **S&P 500 vs. 200-day MA** | Above 200-DMA (6,517) | Healthy medium-term trend intact |
| **NYSE Advance/Decline** | Mixed; 2.17:1 decliners on Thursday | Friday rally improved breadth |
| **Cumulative A/D Line** | Made new all-time high Feb 6; since cooled | Underlying participation still solid |

### Volatility

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **VIX** | **19.09** (Feb 20 close) | Elevated from mid-teens; pierced 20+ earlier in week |
| **VIX trend** | Rose to 2026 highs mid-week before pulling back | Tariff uncertainty + GDP miss drove fear spike |
| **VIX context** | Above 15 (complacency) but below 25 (stress) | Moderate caution; not panic |

### Put/Call Ratios (Feb 20)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **CBOE Equity Put/Call** | **0.65** | Bullish (below 0.70 threshold); suggests complacency |
| **CBOE Total Put/Call** | **0.90** | Neutral to slightly bearish |
| **SPX Put/Call** | **1.28** | Institutional hedging elevated; protective puts in place |

**Sentiment read:** The equity put/call at 0.65 is notably low, suggesting retail bullishness and potential for a contrarian pullback. However, the elevated SPX put/call at 1.28 shows institutional accounts are hedging -- a divergence that often precedes choppy price action. The VIX at 19.09 has cooled from its intra-week peak but remains above the complacency zone.

## Thesis Watchlist

### AI Infrastructure

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx. Feb 20) | Weekly Move | Catalyst / Notes |
|--------|---------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **NVDA** | NVIDIA | ~$185 | Flat; range-bound ahead of earnings | Q4 FY2026 earnings Feb 25 is the single biggest market catalyst. Consensus $65.6B revenue. Stock essentially flat YTD after massive 2024-2025 run. |
| **AVGO** | Broadcom | ~$333 | Moderate | Trading below $340; custom silicon narrative intact; XPU business doubling |
| **TSM** | TSMC | Data not available | -- | CoWoS capacity remains the binding constraint on AI chip supply |
| **VRT** | Vertiv | ~$244 | Positive | Power/cooling demand remains robust; $9.5B backlog |
| **ANET** | Arista Networks | ~$139 | Moderate | 800G DC switching cycle continues |
| **MU** | Micron | Data not available | -- | HBM demand structural; cheapest AI semi valuation |
| **ETN** | Eaton | Data not available | -- | DC orders +200%; data center power distribution |
| **GLW** | Corning | Data not available | -- | Fiber demand from AI clusters |
| **PLTR** | Palantir | ~$135 | Roughly flat | Down ~27% from 2026 highs; still 190x P/E. AIP enterprise momentum strong. |
| **CEG** | Constellation Energy | Data not available | Positive trend | Largest nuclear fleet; TMI restart + hyperscaler PPAs drive structural re-rating |

### Nuclear Energy

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **CEG** | Constellation Energy | Positive YTD | ~22.6 GW fleet; Microsoft + Meta PPAs; Calpine acquisition creates 55 GW clean energy giant |
| **VST** | Vistra | Positive YTD | Meta 2,609 MW deal; trading at 14-16x fwd P/E; ~73-93% earnings growth in 2026 |
| **CCJ** | Cameco | Surged 140%+ past year | Uranium spot near $100/lb; supply deficit ~30-40M lbs/year; rising contract prices |
| **LEU** | Centrus Energy | Data not available | Only Western HALEU producer; $900M DOE expansion |

| **OKLO** | Oklo | ~$11B market cap | 1.2 GW Meta deal; pre-revenue; high speculative premium |

**Nuclear sector note:** Uranium spot prices hovering near $100/lb as structural supply deficit persists. The nuclear renaissance narrative remains strong, driven by AI data center power demand (projected to more than double to 1,000+ TWh by 2030). Hyperscalers have now committed 10+ GW of nuclear capacity.

### Defense & Aerospace

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx. Feb 20) | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| **LMT** | Lockheed Martin | ~$667 | Up ~48% from Aug 2025; FY2026 guide $77.5-80B (+5%); $194B backlog at 16x fwd P/E. Pentagon review caused brief weakness. |
| **RTX** | RTX Corporation | ~$200 | $268B backlog (3.0x revenue); five landmark missile framework agreements; 2-4x production increases |
| **NOC** | Northrop Grumman | ~$703 | $95.7B backlog; B-21 production acceleration; GPI prime contractor |

| **RKLB** | Rocket Lab | ~$71 | $1.33B+ SDA contracts; earnings Feb 26; Neutron development is key catalyst |

**Defense sector note:** Pentagon launched an "extended review period" for defense contractor performance mid-week, briefly weighing on primes. However, book-to-bill ratios above 1.0x sector-wide and $800B+ combined backlogs confirm the structural supercycle remains intact. AeroVironment and Kratos are "moving like tech stocks" with 60-70%+ YTD gains on drone/autonomous warfare demand.

### Cybersecurity

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **PANW** | Palo Alto Networks | ~$155-160 (post-earnings drop) | Reported Q2 FY2026 Feb 17: revenue $2.6B (+15%); shares -7% on Feb 18 due to tightening margins from $25B CyberArk acquisition. Also acquired Koi Security ($400M). Platformization thesis intact but near-term margin pressure. |
| **CRWD** | CrowdStrike | ~$389 | Down ~8% recently; FY2027 guidance coming next quarter; Charlotte AI and Falcon Flex momentum |
| **FTNT** | Fortinet | Positive | Smoked Q4 expectations (adj EPS $0.81); 40% SASE billings surge; FortiGate refresh cycle driving growth |

| **LDOS** | Leidos | ~$22-23B market cap | $46.2B backlog; defense cyber leader |
| **CACI** | CACI International | ~$11B market cap | 12.6% organic growth; $33.9B backlog; cleanest defense cyber story |

### Critical Minerals & Commodities

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **FCX** | Freeport-McMoRan | Data not available | Grasberg restart Q2 2026 is near-term catalyst; copper structural deficit from 2026 |
| **ALB** | Albemarle | Data not available | Lithium recovery: spot above $20,000/tonne; Kings Mountain restart; cost restructuring complete |
| **MP** | MP Materials | Up 115% past year | Only integrated US mine-to-magnet; DOD largest shareholder; $400M equity partnership |
| **SQM** | SQM | Data not available | Lowest-cost lithium; Codelco JV through 2060 |
| **UUUU** | Energy Fuels | Data not available | Dual uranium/REE; commercial Dy/Tb targeted Q4 2026 |

**Minerals note:** Copper facing projected 150,000-330,000 tonne deficit starting 2026. Lithium has stabilized above $20,000/tonne after the brutal 85% crash. China's export control architecture remains intact despite November 2025 temporary suspension. MP Materials' 115% gain reflects the strategic premium on Western rare earth supply chain independence.

### Energy Storage & EV

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **TSLA** | Tesla | ~$412 | Flat; Optimus mass production underway (targeting 50K units 2026); Cybercab production start April 2026; energy storage 46.7 GWh deployed |

### Space

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx. Feb 20) | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| **PL** | Planet Labs | ~$23.45 | Up 21% YTD; $734.5M backlog (+216%); defense EO contracts inflecting; near breakeven |
| **RKLB** | Rocket Lab | ~$71 | Earnings Feb 26; $1.1B backlog; SDA Tranche 2/3 contracts totaling $1.33B+; Neutron development key |
| **LUNR** | Intuitive Machines | ~$17.51 | Soared Feb 18 on KeyBanc PT raise ($20->$26) and NASA Artemis II collaboration; consensus $919M revenue FY2026 |
| **BKSY** | BlackSky | Data not available | $322.7M backlog; 91% international; Strong Buy consensus |

**Space note:** Intuitive Machines surged this week on analyst upgrades and Artemis II inclusion. Artemis II launch scheduled for March 6, 2026 -- a potential catalyst for the entire lunar/space sector. SpaceX IPO (mid-2026, ~$1.5T target) remains the sector-defining event.

### Quantum Computing

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **IONQ** | IonQ | Down >20% YTD | Earnings Feb 25; validating $106-110M FY2025 revenue; 99.99% gate fidelity; 900+ patents |

| **IBM** | IBM | ~$230B market cap | $1B+ quantum cumulative revenue; Kookaburra QEC processor targeted 2026 |
| **HON** | Honeywell | ~$145B market cap | 53% Quantinuum stake; Quantinuum IPO at $20B+ would unlock ~7% of HON value |

**Quantum note:** Pure-play quantum stocks (IONQ, QBTS, RGTI) have all declined >20% from January highs as investors rotated toward more conservative positions. The Quantinuum IPO (S-1 filed Jan 2026) remains the highest-profile quantum market event of the year. IonQ earnings on Feb 25 will be an important data point.

### Robotics / Automation

| Ticker | Company | Price (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **ISRG** | Intuitive Surgical | ~$176B market cap | 11,106 da Vinci systems; 85% recurring revenue; da Vinci 5 upgrade cycle |
| **SYK** | Stryker | ~$141B market cap | 3,000+ Mako systems; spine/shoulder expansion |

## Key Themes This Week

1. **Supreme Court tariff ruling reshapes trade landscape.** The 6-3 IEEPA ruling is the most significant trade policy decision in decades, striking down Trump's emergency tariff authority. However, Trump's immediate imposition of a 10% "global tariff" via executive order limits the market relief. The $133B+ in already-collected tariff revenue creates a major refund question. Net effect: reduced tariff uncertainty short-term, but new tariff uncertainty emerging.

2. **Stagflation signal flashes.** Q4 GDP at 1.4% (well below 2.9% consensus) combined with core PCE accelerating to 3.0% presents the worst macro combination for the Fed: slowing growth + sticky inflation. The government shutdown impact (~1.0pp drag) provides some cover, but the private economy at 2.4% is also decelerating.

3. **Energy sector dominance continues.** The rotation from tech into energy is the defining trade of early 2026, with energy outperforming Nasdaq by ~1,200 bps in six weeks. This is not just an oil story -- it is the market recognizing that AI infrastructure requires physical power infrastructure.

4. **NVIDIA earnings (Feb 25) is the next binary event.** With $65.6B consensus revenue and the stock flat YTD, NVIDIA's report will either validate the continued AI infrastructure supercycle or trigger a narrative reset. Commentary on Rubin architecture, inference demand, and custom silicon competition will be closely watched.

5. **Defense structural supercycle confirmed by backlogs.** Combined prime contractor backlogs exceed $800B. AeroVironment's 151% revenue increase and $3.5B in contract awards underscore the autonomous warfare demand wave. The FCC's ban on Chinese drone manufacturers creates domestic monopoly dynamics.
