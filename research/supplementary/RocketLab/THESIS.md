## Executive Summary

Rocket Lab is the only publicly traded, pure-play orbital launch company with proven execution — and it is rapidly becoming much more than a launch company. Through five strategic acquisitions ($400M+) and $1.33B in SDA defense prime contracts, RKLB has transformed from a small-rocket startup into a vertically integrated space company that designs, manufactures, and launches complete spacecraft from the component level up. No other public company offers this end-to-end capability.

**The core tension:** The business is excellent and improving — 48% YoY revenue growth, record 37% gross margins, 21 consecutive successful launches, and a backlog approaching $2B. But the stock trades at ~64x trailing P/S, pricing in years of flawless execution. Neutron (medium-lift rocket, first flight targeting mid-to-late 2026) is the binary catalyst: success validates the premium and opens a $10B+ TAM; failure or significant delay could trigger 50%+ drawdowns. The probability-weighted expected value suggests the stock is 20-35% overvalued at current levels, with the risk/reward favoring patience for new positions.

**Why now:** Earnings on February 26, 2026 will provide Q4 2025 results, FY2025 totals, and critically, an updated Neutron timeline following the January 2026 tank rupture. The SpaceX/xAI combined entity (~$1.25T valuation after February 2026 merger; SpaceX standalone ~$800B) and a potential IPO/tender will re-rate the entire space sector. SDA contract revenue is inflecting. The next 6-12 months will likely determine whether RKLB's premium is justified or unsustainable.

### What Rocket Lab Actually Is

Rocket Lab is three businesses in one:

1. **Launch Services (~29% of revenue):** Electron small-lift rocket — 81 missions, ~95% lifetime success rate, 21/21 in 2025, second-most-active launcher globally behind SpaceX. Neutron medium-lift rocket in development.

2. **Space Systems (~71% of revenue):** Satellite buses (Lightning/Photon), defense satellite prime contractor ($1.33B SDA backlog), and the Geost EO/IR payload division. This is the larger and faster-growing segment.

3. **Component Supply:** SolAero (1 of 2 US space solar cell producers), Sinclair reaction wheels/star trackers, PSC separation systems, ASI flight software, Mynaric laser communications (pending). These components are sold to competitors and internal programs alike.

The strategic vision: own every layer from components to bus to payload to launch to on-orbit operations. SpaceX is the only company with comparable vertical integration, but SpaceX builds for itself (Starlink). Rocket Lab sells the complete stack to external customers.

## Financial Profile

### Revenue Trajectory

| Year | Revenue | YoY Growth | Key Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2021 | $62.2M | — | Early Electron commercialization |
| 2022 | $211.0M | +239% | Acquisitions (SolAero, PSC, ASI) ramp |
| 2023 | $244.6M | +16% | Growth pause; legacy contract wind-down |
| 2024 | $436.2M | +78% | SDA contracts + Electron cadence ramp |
| 2025E | ~$597-620M | +37% | Continued SDA + record launch year |
| 2026E | ~$892M | +48-50% | SDA T2TL-Beta production + T3 ramp |

**CAGR (2021-2025E): ~76%** — exceptional for a hardware-intensive space company.

### Margin Expansion — The Inflection Story

| Period | GAAP Gross Margin | Non-GAAP GM | Adj. EBITDA Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY2023 | ~21% | ~26% | Deep negative |
| Q1 2025 | 28.8% | ~33% | -25% |
| Q2 2025 | 32.1% | 36.9% | -18% |
| Q3 2025 | **37.0%** | **41.9%** | -17% |
| Q4 2025 Guide | 37-39% | 43-45% | ~-15% |

GAAP gross margin has expanded significantly from ~21% to 37% in two years, driven by: higher-margin SDA contract revenue replacing legacy SolAero work, Electron pricing power ($6.4M/launch in 2021 to $10M+ in Q3 2025), and scale benefits.

### Path to Profitability

| Milestone | Expected Timeline |
|---|---|
| Adj. EBITDA approaching breakeven | Late FY2026 |
| Adj. EBITDA positive (sustained) | FY2027 |
| Positive free cash flow | FY2027 |
| GAAP net income positive | FY2027-2028 |

The company is still burning cash (9M 2025 FCF: -$207.6M), primarily driven by Neutron CapEx (~$142M annualized) and SDA production ramp. But with $808M cash, $1B+ liquidity, and 3+ years of runway, there is no near-term solvency risk.

### Balance Sheet

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Cash & equivalents | $807.9M |
| Total debt | ~$415M (convertible notes $347M net + long-term borrowings $51.3M + current installments $17.1M) |
| Net cash | ~$393M |
| Backlog | ~$1.9B (including Dec 2025 SDA T3 award) |
| Shares outstanding | ~529M (diluted) |
| Convertible note dilution | ~69M additional shares at $5.13 conversion price (deep ITM) |

## The SDA Contracts — Crown Jewels

Rocket Lab's $1.33B+ in SDA prime contracts are the most consequential development in the company's history — transforming it from launch provider to defense satellite prime in under two years.

### Contract Details

| Program | Value | Satellites | Scope | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T2 Transport Layer-Beta** | $515M | 18 | Secure military data relay (JADC2 backbone) | Launch by Jul 2027 |
| **T3 Tracking Layer** | $816M | 18 | Missile warning/tracking (hypersonics detection) | Launch FY2029 |
| **Total** | **$1.33B+** | **36** | End-to-end satellite prime | 2027-2029 |

### Why This Matters

1. **Scale validation:** SDA awarded RKLB an equal share (18 of 72 T3 satellites) alongside Lockheed Martin, L3Harris, and Northrop Grumman — companies with 50-100x its revenue.

2. **Per-unit competitiveness:** RKLB's ~$45M/satellite cost for T3 is competitive with legacy primes ($42-61M range across all four vendors).

3. **Vertical integration advantage:** RKLB builds the bus, solar cells, reaction wheels, star trackers, flight software, AND the EO/IR payload (Phoenix sensor + StarLite space protection sensors) in-house. No other T3 vendor matches this integration depth.

4. **Cross-program leverage:** StarLite sensors have been adopted by competing T3 prime contractors — RKLB profits from every T3 satellite built, not just its own 18.

5. **CDR speed:** Completed Critical Design Review for T2TL-Beta within ~18 months of award. Legacy programs routinely take 3-5+ years to CDR. Speed is the moat.

## Competitive Moat Assessment

### The Integration Stack — No One Else Has This

| Layer | Capability | Acquired Via |
|---|---|---|
| Launch (small) | Electron (81+ flights) | Organic |
| Launch (medium) | Neutron (in development) | Organic |
| Spacecraft bus | Lightning / Photon / Flatellite | Organic |
| Solar cells | SolAero — 1 of 2 US producers | Acquired ($80M) |
| Reaction wheels | Sinclair heritage | Acquired |
| Star trackers | Sinclair heritage | Acquired |
| Flight software | ASI MAX platform | Acquired |
| Separation systems | Planetary Systems Corp | Acquired ($81M) |
| Laser comms | Mynaric CONDOR terminals | Acquisition pending (~$75M) |
| EO/IR payloads | Geost (missile tracking sensors) | Acquired ($275M) |

**The moat is the combination.** No other public company offers launch + bus + payload + components from a single provider. SpaceX has comparable integration but doesn't sell to external customers. Legacy primes build satellites but don't have their own rockets.

### Moat Durability

| Component | Durability | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Electron flight heritage | **Very High** | 81+ missions; only credible small-launch competitor is Firefly Alpha (early-stage) |
| SDA prime relationship | **High** | $1.33B earned trust; program of record with Congressional funding |
| Vertical integration | **High** | $400M+ in acquisitions over 5 years; not replicable quickly |
| SolAero market position | **High** | 1 of 2 US producers; national security designation; CHIPS Act funding |
| Regulatory barriers | **Very High** | FAA licenses, ITAR compliance, facility clearances, bilateral TSAs |
| Neutron (future) | **Unproven** | Binary outcome — success opens massive TAM; failure destroys the premium |

### Key Competitive Risks

- **SpaceX Starship:** If Starship achieves $2-10M per launch, it undercuts everything. Mitigation: Starship is overkill for most missions; Electron/Neutron sell flexibility and dedicated orbits.
- **SpaceX rideshare:** Pressures small launch economics at ~$5,000/kg vs Electron's ~$26,000/kg. Mitigation: Different markets — dedicated orbit, schedule control, classified payloads.
- **Fixed-price execution:** SDA contracts are firm-fixed-price. Cost overruns come from RKLB's margin. First-time production at this scale carries real risk.

## Neutron — The Make-or-Break Catalyst

### Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|---|---|
| Payload to LEO (reusable) | 13,000 kg |
| Payload to LEO (expendable) | 15,000 kg |
| Engines | 9x Archimedes (LOX/methane, staged combustion) |
| Total thrust | ~1,450,000 lbf |
| Target price | ~$50-55M/launch |
| Reusability | First stage landing (drone ship or RTLS) |
| Design | Carbon composite; "Hungry Hippo" integrated fairing |

### Development Status (Feb 2026)

- Archimedes engine: Multiple successful hot fires at NASA Stennis, including 102% power level
- Launch Complex 3 at Wallops: Complete and operationally ready (Aug 2025)
- Stage 2 composite structure: Qualified (Apr 2025, withstood 1.3M lbs tensile force)
- Drone ship "Return On Investment": Under modification at Bollinger Shipyards
- NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1: Selected (Mar 2025) — $5.6B IDIQ ceiling, 5-year ordering period
- **January 2026 setback:** Stage 1 tank rupture during hydrostatic pressure test. No injuries, no facility damage. Next tank already in production.
- **First flight:** Now targeting mid-to-late 2026. Updated timeline expected at Feb 26 earnings.
- **Cumulative spend:** ~$360M through end of 2025; estimated $300-600M more to complete.

### Why Neutron Matters

At $38B market cap, Neutron success is already priced in. The valuation implies RKLB becomes a major launch provider alongside SpaceX. Without Neutron, RKLB is a solid but overvalued small launch + satellite company.

With Neutron:
- Opens the medium-lift market (~$10B+ TAM)
- Enables NSSL contract wins (~$734M+ per task order based on first Lane 1 award to SpaceX)
- Flatellite design packs 16 satellites per Neutron launch — full end-to-end constellation deployment
- Point-to-point cargo test flight for US military tapped for 2026

## Valuation

### Current Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Stock Price | ~$70.86 (Feb 20, 2026) |
| Market Cap | ~$35-38B |
| Enterprise Value | ~$37.3B |
| P/S (Trailing) | ~63-67x |
| P/S (Forward FY2026E) | ~42x |
| EV/Revenue (Forward) | ~42x |
| 52-Week Range | $14.71 – $99.58 |
| Distance from ATH | ~32% below |

### Comparable Companies

| Company | P/S (TTM) | Revenue Growth | Profitable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RKLB** | **~64x** | **48% YoY** | **No (improving)** |
| SpaceX (private) | ~50x* | ~30-40% | Yes |
| Palantir | ~72x | 56% | Yes |
| Anduril (private) | ~80x | 138% | Unknown |
| Firefly (FLY) | ~52x | ~150% (FY2025E) | No |
| LUNR | ~10x | 8% | No |
| LMT | ~2.0x | 5% | Yes |

*SpaceX standalone ~$800B; combined SpaceX/xAI entity valued at ~$1.25T after February 2026 merger. P/S based on ~$15.5B SpaceX revenue.

RKLB trades at a premium to SpaceX (unusual for a company 25x smaller) but below Palantir's ~72x P/S (down from 100x+ in late 2024). The premium reflects public market scarcity — RKLB is the only liquid pure-play space stock at scale.

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | 2028E Revenue | P/S | Market Cap | Price | vs. Current |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bull** | 20-25% | $1.5-2.0B | 25-35x | $50-70B | $95-130 | +40% to +93% |
| **Base** | 50-55% | $1.0-1.2B | 15-20x | $22-30B | $42-57 | -37% to -16% |
| **Bear** | 20-25% | $700-900M | 5-10x | $5-10B | $10-19 | -85% to -72% |

**Probability-weighted expected value: ~$45-55/share** — suggesting 20-35% overvaluation at current levels.

### Stress Test: Moderate Disappointment

If Neutron delays to 2028 AND FY2026 revenue comes in at $750M (vs $892M consensus):
- P/S compresses to 15-25x
- Implied price: **$21-36** (47-69% downside)
- This is not the bear case — this is "good but not great"

## Risk Matrix

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Valuation compression** | CRITICAL | At 64x P/S, any stumble triggers severe drawdowns. The premium requires perfection. |
| **Neutron execution** | HIGH | Tank rupture in Jan 2026. First flight pushed to mid-late 2026. Further delays could break the narrative. |
| **Fixed-price contract margin** | HIGH | $1.33B in FFP SDA contracts. First-time satellite production at scale. Cost overruns eat margin directly. |
| **SpaceX dominance** | MEDIUM | 86% of global upmass. Starship could commoditize launch economics entirely. |
| **Cash burn** | MEDIUM | -$207.6M FCF through 9M 2025. Neutron + SDA ramp is capital-intensive. 3+ years runway but tight. |

### Mitigants

- **Defense tailwind is structural:** USSF budget doubled in 5 years ($15B to $29B). Golden Dome adds $38B+ near-term. Bipartisan support.
- **Backlog provides visibility:** ~$1.9B backlog = ~3 years of revenue at current run rate.
- **Margin trajectory is real:** 21% to 37% GAAP GM in 2 years is not noise — it's operating leverage.
- **SpaceX/xAI liquidity event could be a rising tide:** A SpaceX/xAI IPO or tender at ~$1.25T combined valuation could re-rate all space stocks 20-30% higher.

## Investment Timing Framework

### Near-Term (Q1-Q2 2026) — Catalyst-Dense

| Date | Event | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Feb 26** | Q4 2025 earnings + Neutron timeline update | HIGH — sets the narrative for H1 2026 |
| Mar 6 | Artemis II launch | Sector sentiment catalyst |
| Mid-2026 | SpaceX/xAI IPO or tender (~$1.25T combined) | Sector-defining; reprices all space stocks |
| Mid-Late 2026 | Neutron first flight (if on schedule) | Binary catalyst for RKLB specifically |

### Mid-Term (H2 2026 – 2027)

- SDA T2TL-Beta satellite deliveries and launches (by Jul 2027)
- Neutron commercial operations begin (if first flight successful)
- NSSL Lane 1 task order eligibility (requires Neutron flight heritage)
- Adj. EBITDA approaching breakeven → positive
- Potential S&P MidCap 400 inclusion

### Long-Term (2028-2030)

- SDA Tranche 3 satellite deliveries and launches (FY2029)
- Revenue approaching $1.5B+ if execution continues
- GAAP profitability → S&P 500 eligibility
- Golden Dome constellation expansion contracts
- International defense market penetration (Five Eyes, Japan, NATO)
- Neutron cadence ramp to 5+ launches/year

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **The business is strong and getting stronger.** Revenue CAGR of 76% over 4 years, margin expansion from 21% to 37%, backlog approaching $2B, and a competitive moat built on integration depth no public company can match. This is a real company executing at a high level.

2. **Valuation is the primary risk.** At ~64x trailing P/S, the stock prices in 3-5 years of near-perfect execution. The probability-weighted expected value (~$45-55) suggests 20-35% overvaluation. The asymmetry is unfavorable: upside requires perfection, while moderate disappointment implies severe drawdowns.

3. **Neutron is binary.** Success validates the premium, opens a $10B+ TAM, and positions RKLB as the second major launch provider. Failure or 2+ year delays could send the stock back to $20-40. The January 2026 tank rupture adds uncertainty. The Feb 26 earnings call timeline update is the next critical data point.

4. **SDA contracts are transformational.** $1.33B+ in defense prime contracts, achieved by a company that was purely a launch provider four years ago, demonstrates extraordinary institutional trust and execution capability. The cross-program leverage (StarLite sensors sold to competing primes) is an underappreciated moat.

5. **For investors:** The risk/reward favors patience at current levels. Better entry points are likely at $40-55 (200-DMA / base case valuation floor). For existing holders, the long-term thesis is intact — position sizing should reflect the valuation risk. The Feb 26 earnings and Neutron timeline update will determine near-term direction. The SpaceX/xAI liquidity event (mid-2026) is the sector catalyst that could override individual stock fundamentals.
