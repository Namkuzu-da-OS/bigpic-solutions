## 1. Company Overview

### Founding & History

Rocket Lab was founded in June 2006 by Peter Beck in Auckland, New Zealand. Beck, a self-taught engineer from Invercargill, New Zealand, did not attend university. He apprenticed as a tool-and-die maker at Fisher & Paykel in 1995 and later worked at Industrial Research Limited (2001-2006) on smart materials, composites, and superconductors. After a trip to the United States where he recognized the potential for a low-cost, small-class launch vehicle, Beck founded Rocket Lab with the explicit goal of democratizing access to space.

In 2009, Rocket Lab became the first private company in the Southern Hemisphere to reach space with the successful launch of its Atea-1 sounding rocket. In 2013, the company incorporated in the United States and established U.S. headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, later relocating to Long Beach, California in 2020.

### IPO & Public Listing

Rocket Lab went public via a SPAC merger with Vector Acquisition Corporation (VACQ), announced on March 1, 2021. Key deal terms:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Enterprise Valuation | $4.1 billion |
| Equity Valuation | $4.8 billion |
| Gross Proceeds to RKLB | ~$777 million |
| Trust Account | ~$320 million |
| PIPE Financing | ~$470 million at $10/share |
| PIPE Investors | Vector Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman |
| Trading Commenced | August 25, 2021 on NASDAQ as "RKLB" |

The stock has since appreciated dramatically. As of February 2026, RKLB trades around $70-78 per share with a market capitalization of approximately $38.6 billion -- a roughly 8x increase from its initial public valuation. The stock reached an all-time high of $99.58 on January 16, 2026.

### Mission & Vision

Rocket Lab's stated vision is: *"To be an end-to-end space company, owning the ride to orbit and the spacecraft to deliver the most valuable part of the space chain -- data and services from orbit."*

The company's broader mission statement is: *"We go to space to improve life on Earth."*

Peter Beck has articulated this as building a fully vertically integrated space company that can design, manufacture, launch, and operate spacecraft -- a one-stop destination for customers needing any combination of launch services, satellite buses, components, or complete space missions.

### Scale & Global Footprint

## 2. Electron Launch Vehicle

### Technical Specifications

Electron is a two-stage, partially expendable small-lift orbital launch vehicle. It was the first orbital-class rocket to use 3D-printed, electric-pump-fed engines.

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Height | 18 m (59 ft) |
| Diameter | 1.2 m (3.9 ft) |
| Payload to 500 km SSO | ~200 kg (440 lb) |
| Payload to LEO (lower orbits) | Up to 300 kg (660 lb) |
| First Stage Engines | 9x Rutherford (sea-level) |
| Second Stage Engine | 1x Rutherford (vacuum) |
| First Stage Thrust | ~224 kN (50,400 lbf) total |
| Single Engine Thrust (SL) | 24.9 kN (5,600 lbf) |
| Single Engine Thrust (Vac) | 25.8 kN (5,800 lbf) |
| Engine ISP (SL / Vac) | 311 s / 343 s |
| Engine Mass | ~35 kg each |
| Propellant | RP-1 / LOX |
| Fairing Diameter | 1.2 m |
| Fairing Length | 2.5 m |

The Rutherford engine is a defining technological achievement. It is the world's first 3D-printed, electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital rocket. Using dual brushless DC electric motors powered by lithium polymer batteries, the electric pump cycle achieves approximately 95% efficiency versus the roughly 50% efficiency of a typical gas-generator cycle. Each engine weighs only 35 kg.

### Launch History & Cadence

Electron has compiled one of the strongest track records of any commercial launch vehicle in the small-lift class.

| Year | Launches | Successes | Failures | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2017 | 1 | 0 | 1 | "It's a Test" -- first flight, did not reach orbit |
| 2018 | 3 | 3 | 0 | First orbital success (Jan 2018), first commercial mission (Nov 2018) |
| 2019 | 6 | 6 | 0 | Cadence ramp begins |
| 2020 | 7 | 6 | 1 | Flight 13 failure (electrical connection issue, July 2020) |
| 2021 | 6 | 5 | 1 | Flight 20 "Running Out Of Toes" failure (May 2021) |
| 2022 | 9 | 9 | 0 | Clean year, cadence increase |
| 2023 | 10 | 9 | 1 | Flight 41 failure for Capella Space (Sept 2023, electrical arc) |
| 2024 | 16 | 16 | 0 | Record year, 60% YoY cadence increase |
| 2025 | 21 | 21 | 0 | New record, 100% mission success, 31% YoY cadence increase |
| 2026 (YTD) | 2 | 2 | 0 | Through January 2026; 81st mission launched Jan 30 |
| **Total** | **~81** | **~77** | **~4** | **~95% cumulative success rate** |

The cadence trajectory is notable: 1 --> 3 --> 6 --> 7 --> 6 --> 9 --> 10 --> 16 --> 21 --> 2 (YTD). The company has demonstrated accelerating production throughput year after year, with back-to-back perfect years in 2024 (16/16) and 2025 (21/21). This 39-mission streak with zero failures is a strong operational signal.

### Failure Analysis

Electron has experienced four failures across 81 missions. Three of the four involved electrical system issues in the second stage; the first test flight failed due to a ground equipment error.

- **Flight 1 (May 2017):** "It's a Test" — the first Electron flight reached 224 km altitude but was terminated by range safety after a data loss timeout caused by misconfigured ground telemetry equipment operated by a third-party contractor. The vehicle itself performed nominally. A two-month investigation by Rocket Lab and the FAA confirmed the root cause was ground-side, not a vehicle defect.
- **Flight 13 (July 2020):** Faulty electrical connection caused increasing resistance, heating, and ultimately a power disconnect to the electric turbopumps, shutting down the second stage engine.
- **Flight 20 (May 2021):** Second-stage engine igniter system failure caused engine shutdown shortly after stage separation; telemetry was lost approximately 4 minutes after liftoff.
- **Flight 41 (September 2023):** Electrical arc inside the power supply system shorted out the battery packs powering the second stage engine.

Each failure led to design corrections. The subsequent 39-mission streak with zero failures (including all of 2024, 2025, and January 2026) suggests the root causes have been addressed.

### Kick Stage (In-Space Propulsion)

Electron offers an optional third stage called the Kick Stage, powered by a single 3D-printed Curie engine. This provides critical in-space transportation capabilities:

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Engine | Curie (bipropellant, "green" propellant) |
| Thrust | 120 N (27 lbf) |
| ISP | ~320 s |
| Payload Capacity | Up to 150 kg |
| Capabilities | Multiple burns, orbit circularization, orbit raising/lowering, inclination changes, de-orbit |

The Kick Stage has demonstrated orbit raising to 1,200 km and subsequent de-orbit burns, providing precision orbital delivery that differentiated Electron from competitors. It also served as the technological foundation for the Photon spacecraft bus, enabling Rocket Lab's expansion into the spacecraft business.

### Helicopter Mid-Air Recovery Program

Rocket Lab announced booster recovery and reusability plans for Electron's first stage in August 2019. The program aimed to use helicopters to catch the descending first stage mid-air via a parachute grappling system.

**Key milestones:**
- **March 2020:** Successfully tested mid-air catch concept with a replica stage in New Zealand.
- **May 2022:** A helicopter successfully captured a live Electron first stage after launch, but the pilot released it seconds later after detecting unexpected load characteristics. The booster was recovered from the ocean by ship.
- **Late 2022-2023:** After one successful-but-released helicopter catch (May 2022) and one aborted attempt due to telemetry loss (November 2022), Rocket Lab abandoned the mid-air catch approach in favor of ocean splashdown recovery.

**Current status:** While the helicopter catch method was abandoned, the recovery program itself yielded tangible results. A recovered Rutherford engine passed five full-duration hot fire tests and was declared flight-ready. Rocket Lab's 40th Electron mission (2023) successfully reused a refurbished Rutherford engine from a previous flight -- marking the first reuse of an Electron engine. The company continues ocean-based recovery operations to refurbish and refly engines, reducing marginal launch costs.

### Key Customers & Missions

Electron has become the dedicated launch vehicle of choice for several constellation operators:

- **Synspective (Japan):** Sole launch provider for their SAR constellation; 21 dedicated Electron launches planned
- **iQPS (Japan):** Primary launcher; 7 satellites deployed through 2025, 7+ additional missions booked
- **Kineis (France):** Multi-launch IoT constellation deployment contract
- **BlackSky:** Dedicated launch partnership
- **U.S. Space Force / NRO:** Multiple national security missions including STP-S30 and DiskSat deployments
- **NASA:** CAPSTONE lunar mission (via Photon), multiple science missions

### Revenue Per Launch

Electron's unit economics have improved meaningfully:

| Period | Avg. Revenue Per Launch | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 Average | ~$7.8 million | $125M launch revenue / 16 launches |
| Q3 2024 Contracts | ~$8.4 million ASP | New contract pricing |
| Q3 2025 | ~$10+ million | 44.3% YoY revenue-per-launch increase |

Cost per launch increased only 18% YoY in Q3 2025 while revenue per launch increased 44.3%, indicating expanding unit margins. The company charged approximately $5 million per launch in earlier years, meaning pricing power has roughly doubled since Electron's early commercial operations.

## 3. Neutron Medium-Lift Vehicle

### Technical Specifications

Neutron is a partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle under development. It represents Rocket Lab's bid to compete in the high-value medium-to-heavy launch market currently dominated by SpaceX's Falcon 9.

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Height | 43 m (141 ft) |
| Diameter (Stage 1) | 7 m (23 ft) |
| Diameter (Stage 2) | 4.9 m (16 ft) |
| Liftoff Mass | 480,000 kg (1,058,000 lb) |
| Payload to LEO (expendable) | 15,000 kg (33,100 lb) |
| Payload to LEO (downrange landing) | 13,000 kg (28,700 lb) |
| Payload to LEO (RTLS) | 8,500 kg (18,700 lb) |
| Fairing Diameter | 5.5 m |
| Usable Payload Length | 16.5 m |
| First Stage Engines | 9x Archimedes |
| Second Stage Engine | 1x Archimedes |
| Total First Stage Thrust | ~1,450,000 lbf (6,450 kN) |
| Single Engine Thrust | ~165,000 lbf (734 kN) |
| Engine Cycle | Oxidizer-rich staged combustion |
| Propellant | Methalox (LNG / LOX) |
| Reusability | First stage landing (drone ship or RTLS) |

**Design innovations:**

- **"Hungry Hippo" Fairing:** Unlike conventional rockets that jettison fairings, Neutron's payload fairing is integrated with the first stage via hinges. The fairing halves open like jaws to release the payload, then remain attached to the booster for recovery. This eliminates the need for fairing recovery operations.
- **Carbon Composite Structure:** The entire vehicle uses carbon composite construction, making it lighter than metallic alternatives and enabling the wide, squat body profile needed for aerodynamic stability during return.
- **7-Meter Diameter:** A deliberately wide first stage driven by re-entry aerodynamics rather than payload requirements. The short, wide, and lightweight body provides stability during booster flyback without the need for heavy grid fins or extensive RCS systems.

### Archimedes Engine

The Archimedes is a new oxidizer-rich staged combustion cycle engine purpose-built for Neutron. Unlike the electric-pump-fed Rutherford, Archimedes is a conventional turbopump engine designed for the higher thrust requirements of a medium-lift vehicle.

**Development milestones:**
- **August 2024:** First successful hot fire test at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Engine reached 102% power level.
- **2025:** Continued hot fire test campaign with progression toward full-duration firings. Multiple successful tests completed throughout the year.
- **Upcoming:** Full-duration hot fire of a single Archimedes, followed by a 9-engine cluster test on a full Stage 1 test article.

The engine uses cryogenic methalox propellant (liquid methane/LOX), chosen for higher reusability characteristics and cleaner combustion compared to RP-1. Archimedes is designed to operate at lower stress levels than competing engines to enable rapid and reliable reusability across many flights.

### Current Development Status

**2025 milestones achieved:**
- Archimedes engine hot fire test campaign progressed through multiple successful firings
- Second-stage carbon composite structure qualified in April (withstood 1.3 million pounds of tensile force)
- Launch Complex 3 at Wallops declared operationally ready (August 2025), including 700-ton steel/concrete launch mount, 200,000-gallon water deluge system, and propellant tank farm
- Drone ship "Return On Investment" (400 ft) contracted to Bollinger Shipyards for landing platform modifications
- First multi-launch Neutron contract signed with a confidential commercial constellation operator

**January 2026 setback:** On January 21, 2026, a Stage 1 tank ruptured during a hydrostatic pressure qualification test at Rocket Lab's Space Structures Complex in Middle River, Maryland. No injuries were reported, and no significant damage occurred to the test facility. The next Stage 1 tank was already in production at the time. Rocket Lab stated they intended to provide an updated Neutron schedule during the Q4 2025 earnings call on February 26, 2026.

**Timeline:** Neutron's first launch was originally targeted for mid-2025, then pushed to Q1 2026, and is now expected no earlier than mid-to-late 2026 following the tank rupture. Rocket Lab had previously planned 3 Neutron launches in 2026 and 5 in 2027. Those targets are now under review.

### Target Markets

Neutron is purpose-built for three primary markets:

1. **Mega-constellation deployment:** The 13,000 kg capacity is positioned as the "sweet spot" for deploying batches of satellites for planned mega-constellations. Constellation operators are desperate for alternatives to the current SpaceX monopoly.
2. **National Security Space Launch (NSSL):** On March 27, 2025, Neutron was selected for the U.S. Space Force's NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program -- a firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with a 5-year ordering period (through June 2029) and a maximum value of $5.6 billion across all Lane 1 providers. A minimum of 30 missions are planned for the program. Rocket Lab is one of only five providers selected.
3. **Human spaceflight potential:** While not the immediate focus, Neutron is being designed with the structural margins and safety characteristics that could support eventual human-rating.

### Competitive Positioning

| Vehicle | Operator | Payload to LEO | Status | Approx. Cost/Launch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Falcon 9** | SpaceX | ~22,800 kg | Operational (~615 flights) | ~$67 million |
| **Neutron** | Rocket Lab | 13,000 kg (reusable) | Development (mid-2026 target) | ~$50 million (projected) |
| **New Glenn** | Blue Origin | ~45,000 kg | First flight Jan 2025 | Est. $100+ million |
| **Vulcan Centaur** | ULA | ~27,200 kg | Operational (first flight 2024) | Est. $100-110 million |
| **Terran R** | Relativity Space | ~23,500 kg | Development | Unknown |

Neutron does not aim to match Falcon 9 on raw payload capacity. Instead, it targets the constellation deployment segment where 13 tons is sufficient for most batch deployments, at a projected $50 million price point versus Falcon 9's ~$67 million published price. The competitive thesis rests on three pillars: (1) offering a credible alternative to break SpaceX's near-monopoly, (2) lower cost per kg for appropriately-sized payloads, and (3) purpose-built reusable architecture for high-cadence operations.

The risk is real: as of 2024, SpaceX accounted for 86% of global upmass launched. Neutron must prove its reusability and cadence to be a viable competitor, which could take 3-5 years after first flight.

### Capital Requirements

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Spent through end of 2025 | ~$360 million |
| Estimated cost to complete | $300-600 million (industry estimates) |
| Cash position (late 2025) | ~$1 billion+ |
| ATM equity raise (Q3 2025) | $468.8 million |

Rocket Lab's CFO indicated approximately $360 million had been spent on Neutron development through the end of 2025, including roughly $15 million per quarter in workforce costs. Three aerospace executives estimated in early 2025 that completing Neutron through to profitability would require an additional $300-600 million beyond what had been spent. The company bolstered its balance sheet with a $468.8 million at-the-market equity offering in Q3 2025, bringing total cash to over $1 billion.

### Make-or-Break Assessment

At Rocket Lab's current market capitalization of ~$38.6 billion, Neutron's success is already priced into the stock. The valuation implies Rocket Lab will become a major launch provider alongside SpaceX. If Neutron suffers significant further delays, cost overruns, or fails to achieve reusability, the investment thesis at current prices faces serious challenges. Conversely, successful execution would validate the end-to-end space company model and open up a launch TAM that dwarfs Electron's addressable market.

## 4. Space Systems Division

Rocket Lab's Space Systems division is the less visible but strategically critical half of the business. Through a series of acquisitions and organic development, the company has built a vertically integrated spacecraft manufacturing capability that spans components, subsystems, satellite buses, flight software, and now payloads.

### Photon Satellite Bus Platform

Photon evolved from the Electron Kick Stage into a family of configurable spacecraft platforms:

| Variant | Application | Key Capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Photon** | LEO missions | Standard satellite bus for hosted payloads |
| **Lightning** | LEO missions | Rapid-build, high-volume production variant |
| **Pioneer** | LEO missions | Enhanced capability bus |
| **Explorer** | Deep space | High delta-V for lunar and interplanetary missions |

**Notable Photon missions:**
- **CAPSTONE (June 2022):** Photon Explorer delivered NASA's CAPSTONE cubesat on a trans-lunar injection trajectory. After six apogee-raising burns over six days, the Photon upper stage sent CAPSTONE toward the Moon's near-rectilinear halo orbit -- the same orbit planned for NASA's Gateway station. This was the first deep-space mission for a private small-launch company.
- **Venus Life Finder (planned ~2026):** A private interplanetary mission using Photon Explorer as a cruise stage to deliver a small atmospheric probe to Venus, in collaboration with MIT. Originally planned for 2023, now targeting no earlier than summer 2026.

### Acquisition Strategy

Rocket Lab executed a deliberate acquisition campaign from 2020-2025 to fill gaps in its vertical integration stack. Each acquisition brought specific components or capabilities that the company previously sourced externally.

| Company | Acquired | Price | Location | Capabilities Added |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sinclair Interplanetary** | April 2020 | Undisclosed | Toronto, Canada | Reaction wheels, star trackers, satellite attitude determination and control hardware |
| **Advanced Solutions Inc. (ASI)** | October 2021 | ~$40M (+$5.5M earnout) | Littleton, Colorado | Flight software, ground software, mission simulation, spacecraft autonomy |
| **Planetary Systems Corp. (PSC)** | December 2021 | $81.4 million | Maryland | Satellite separation systems, deployment mechanisms |
| **SolAero Holdings** | January 2022 | $80 million | Albuquerque, New Mexico | Space-grade solar cells, solar panels, precision aerospace structures |
| **Geost, LLC** | August 2025 | $275 million + up to $50M earnout | Arizona & Virginia | Electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor payloads, missile warning/tracking systems |

**Sinclair Interplanetary** brought flight-proven satellite hardware. Founded in 2001 by Doug Sinclair, the company's reaction wheels and star trackers had flown on over 90 satellites before acquisition. Beck explained that these components were "incredibly long lead-time items" and Rocket Lab determined they either needed to build their own or acquire a company that made them. In 2021, Rocket Lab opened a new high-volume reaction wheel production facility to scale output.

**Advanced Solutions Inc. (ASI)** filled the flight software gap. ASI's MAX Flight Software platform and ground operations tools gave Rocket Lab proprietary spacecraft flight software rather than relying on third-party solutions.

**Planetary Systems Corporation** provided satellite separation systems -- the mechanical interfaces that connect satellites to launch vehicles and deploy them in orbit. PSC's mechanisms are used across the industry, giving Rocket Lab both internal supply and external revenue from competitors.

**SolAero Holdings** was the marquee industrial acquisition. SolAero is one of only two companies in the United States producing high-efficiency, space-grade solar cells, and operates the world's largest production line for high-performance space solar cells. Their products have supported over 1,000 successful space missions with 100% reliability, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe, Mars InSight Lander, and multiple Cygnus cargo resupply missions to the ISS. SolAero's latest IMM-beta solar cell technology achieves average BOL conversion efficiency of ~33.3%, among the highest in the industry.

**Geost** was the most recent and most expensive acquisition at $275 million (plus a potential $50 million earnout tied to revenue targets). Geost, founded in 2004, develops electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor systems for national security space missions. This acquisition extended Rocket Lab's vertical integration beyond the spacecraft bus into the payload itself -- specifically for missile warning, missile tracking, tactical ISR, Earth observation, and space domain awareness missions. This positions Rocket Lab as a "disruptive prime" for U.S. national security space programs.

### Vertical Integration -- What RKLB Manufactures In-House

After five acquisitions, Rocket Lab now manufactures an unusually comprehensive set of space hardware internally:

| Component | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Launch vehicles (Electron, Neutron) | In-house | Full rocket manufacturing |
| Rutherford engines | In-house | 3D-printed, electric pump-fed |
| Archimedes engines | In-house | Under development for Neutron |
| Reaction wheels | In-house (ex-Sinclair) | High-volume production facility |
| Star trackers | In-house (ex-Sinclair) | Attitude determination hardware |
| Flight software | In-house (ex-ASI) | MAX Flight Software platform |
| Ground software | In-house (ex-ASI) | Mission operations |
| Separation systems | In-house (ex-PSC) | Satellite deployment mechanisms |
| Space solar cells | In-house (ex-SolAero) | World's largest production line |
| Solar panels & structures | In-house (ex-SolAero) | Precision aerospace structures |
| EO/IR sensor payloads | In-house (ex-Geost) | Missile tracking, ISR, space domain awareness |
| Satellite buses (Photon) | In-house | Full spacecraft platform |
| Kick Stage / in-space propulsion | In-house | Curie engine, orbital transfer |
| Composite structures | In-house | Carbon composite expertise |
| Avionics | In-house | Guidance, navigation, and control |
| Software-defined radios | In-house | Communications subsystems |

**What RKLB still procures externally:** While comprehensive, the company likely still sources some commodity components (fasteners, connectors, wiring harnesses), certain raw materials (carbon fiber, propellant), some specialized electronics, and ground support equipment. However, the degree of vertical integration across the high-value, long-lead-time components is unmatched among publicly traded space companies.

### Competitive Moat

The vertical integration strategy creates a multi-layered moat:

1. **Supply chain control:** By manufacturing its own long-lead components (reaction wheels, star trackers, solar cells, separation systems), Rocket Lab is insulated from supply chain disruptions that plague competitors.
2. **Cost advantage:** Internal component supply eliminates vendor margins, reducing spacecraft build costs.
3. **Speed advantage:** No waiting in supplier queues. Rocket Lab can accelerate spacecraft production timelines when needed.
4. **End-to-end offering:** Customers can contract for components only, a satellite bus, a satellite bus + launch, or a complete turnkey mission. This flexibility captures more of the value chain per customer.
5. **National security positioning:** The ability to offer launch + spacecraft + payload as an integrated package makes Rocket Lab a viable prime contractor for defense programs -- as evidenced by the SDA contracts.

### National Security Contracts

The Space Systems division has become a primary revenue driver through major defense contracts:

| Contract | Value | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| SDA Transport Layer Tranche 2 Beta | $515 million | 18 satellites for secure military communications |
| SDA Tracking Layer Tranche 3 | $816 million | Missile defense satellite constellation |
| **Total SDA Contract Value** | **$1.3+ billion** | Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture |

These contracts represent Rocket Lab operating as a satellite prime contractor -- designing, building, and delivering complete spacecraft, not just launch services. The $816 million Tracking Layer Tranche 3 contract (awarded December 2025) involves satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for detecting and tracking emerging threats including hypersonic systems.

### Production Capacity & Scaling

Rocket Lab's manufacturing has scaled to support an Electron production rate of roughly one vehicle every 17-18 days, enabling the 21-launch year achieved in 2025. The company has stated targets to further increase Electron cadence toward 25+ launches per year.

For Neutron, the Middle River, Maryland complex houses both the composite structure fabrication and the Archimedes engine production line (the Neutron Archimedes Production Complex, or NAPC). Neutron's carbon composite construction is designed for manufacturing efficiency -- the company has emphasized that composites enable faster production than traditional metallic rocket structures.

## 6. Strategic Positioning

### Only Publicly Traded, Pure-Play Orbital Launch Company

Rocket Lab occupies a unique position in public markets. It is the only publicly traded company that is both:
1. An operational orbital launch provider with a proven track record (81 missions, ~95% success rate)
2. A vertically integrated spacecraft manufacturer with over $1.3 billion in defense prime contracts

SpaceX is private. Blue Origin is private. ULA is a joint venture. Relativity Space is private. For public market investors seeking direct exposure to the orbital launch industry, RKLB is effectively the only option with demonstrated operational capability.

### End-to-End Space Company Thesis

Peter Beck has consistently articulated the "end-to-end" vision: *"I always like to talk about Rocket Lab as an end-to-end space company because it's almost bisected into two parts. There's launch, which is the big roaring stick in the sky, which everybody gets excited about, and then the space systems, which is less visually glamorous, but, of course, a huge part of the business."*

The Q3 2025 backlog split illustrates this duality:
- **Launch backlog:** ~47% of $1.1 billion total
- **Space Systems backlog:** ~53% of $1.1 billion total

Space Systems is already the larger backlog contributor. This is strategically important because launch services are inherently capital-intensive and cadence-limited, while spacecraft manufacturing and component sales can scale more efficiently. The end-to-end model also creates natural cross-selling: a customer buying a Photon satellite bus gets Sinclair reaction wheels, SolAero solar panels, PSC separation systems, ASI flight software, and an Electron launch -- all from one vendor.

### Revenue Trajectory

| Year | Revenue | YoY Growth |
|---|---|---|
| 2021 | $62 million | -- |
| 2022 | $211 million | +239% |
| 2023 | $245 million | +16% |
| 2024 | $436 million | +78% |
| 2025 (TTM Q3) | ~$555 million | +52% |
| Q4 2025 Guidance | $170-180 million | -- |

The revenue trajectory shows strong compounding growth driven by both increasing Electron cadence/pricing and expanding Space Systems contracts. The SDA contracts alone ($1.3B+ total value) will provide revenue visibility over the 2026-2028 period.

### Comparison to Early SpaceX

The SpaceX comparison is frequently invoked by investors and analysts. There are meaningful parallels and important distinctions:

**Parallels:**
- Founded by a visionary, technically hands-on CEO
- Started with a small launch vehicle (Falcon 1 / Electron) before developing a medium-lift vehicle (Falcon 9 / Neutron)
- Pursuing reusability as a core competitive advantage
- Building vertical integration across the space value chain
- Winning government contracts alongside commercial business

**Distinctions:**
- SpaceX was funded by Elon Musk's personal wealth and later by massive private capital raises; Rocket Lab has been more capital-constrained
- Falcon 9 had a 12-year head start and has flown 400+ missions; Neutron has zero flights
- SpaceX dominates with 86% of global upmass; Rocket Lab has less than 0.1%
- SpaceX has Starlink as a captive customer consuming ~50% of launches; Rocket Lab has no equivalent internal demand driver
- SpaceX's Starship targets a fundamentally different scale (100+ tons to LEO)

The comparison is aspirational rather than current-state. Rocket Lab is where SpaceX was circa 2010-2012 -- proven on the small vehicle, developing the medium vehicle, and building out the broader business. Whether it can replicate the trajectory depends entirely on Neutron execution.

### Peter Beck's Leadership

Sir Peter Beck (knighted in 2024 as Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the aerospace industry, business, and education) is a distinctive leader in the space industry:

- **Technical credibility:** Hands-on engineer who designed key Rocket Lab systems, not a financier or manager parachuted in
- **Capital discipline:** Has built Rocket Lab with substantially less capital than competitors backed by billionaires (Musk, Bezos)
- **Execution track record:** Delivered on Electron's promise to become the most frequently launched small rocket globally
- **Strategic clarity:** Articulated and methodically executed the vertical integration strategy over 5 years of acquisitions
- **Skin in the game:** Remains the largest individual shareholder

Beck's leadership style has been described as prioritizing discipline and precision over the spectacle-driven approach of some competitors. The 21-launch, 100% success rate in 2025 reflects an operationally mature organization, not a startup running on ambition alone.

The open question is whether Beck can execute on Neutron -- a vehicle orders of magnitude more complex than Electron -- while simultaneously managing a rapidly scaling Space Systems business and over $1.3 billion in defense prime contracts. The January 2026 tank rupture is a reminder that rocket development remains unforgiving.
