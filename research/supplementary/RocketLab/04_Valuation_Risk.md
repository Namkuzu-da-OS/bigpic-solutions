## 1. Current Valuation Metrics

Rocket Lab trades at a significant premium to nearly every traditional aerospace metric, reflecting the market's conviction that the company is transitioning from a small launch provider into a vertically integrated space prime contractor. Whether that premium is justified is the central question of this report.

### Snapshot (as of February 20, 2026)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Stock Price** | ~$70.86 | Closed Feb 20, 2026 |
| **Market Cap** | ~$35-38B | Varies intraday; ~$37.85B recent reports |
| **Enterprise Value** | ~$37.3B | Market cap + $415M financial debt - $808M cash |
| **Shares Outstanding** | ~513-529M (diluted) | Steady ~3-6% annual dilution from SBC |
| **Trailing 12M Revenue** | ~$555M (9 months through Q3 2025) | Q4 guidance: $170-180M; FY2025E ~$595-600M |
| **Forward Revenue (2026E)** | ~$892M | Consensus of 14 analysts; 61% YoY growth |
| **Price/Sales (TTM)** | ~63-67x | Using ~$595M FY2025E revenue |
| **Price/Sales (Forward 2026E)** | ~42x | Using $892M consensus |
| **EV/Revenue (TTM)** | ~62x | $37.3B EV / ~$600M FY2025E revenue |
| **EV/Revenue (Forward 2026E)** | ~42x | Using ~$892M consensus |
| **Price/Book** | ~28-33x | Book value ~$431M total shareholder equity |
| **52-Week Low** | $14.71 | February 2025 area |
| **52-Week High** | $99.58 | January 16, 2026 (ATH) |
| **Distance from ATH** | ~29% below | Pulled back from $99.58 to ~$71 |

### Historical Valuation Context

Rocket Lab's valuation has expanded dramatically since mid-2024:

- **2023:** P/S ratio hovered around 10-15x on ~$245M revenue
- **2024:** P/S expanded to 20-30x as revenue accelerated to $436M (+78% YoY) and the SDA narrative took hold
- **2025:** P/S exploded to 50-70x as the stock surged 174% on the year, driven by the $515M SDA Tranche 2 contract, $816M Tranche 3 win, Electron launch records, and Neutron anticipation
- **Current:** Despite the pullback from ATH, RKLB remains at peak historical multiples

The key insight: the current valuation does not reflect what Rocket Lab earns today. It reflects a bet on what Rocket Lab becomes over the next 3-5 years -- a multi-billion-dollar space prime contractor with a reusable medium-lift rocket.

### Key Price Levels

| Level | Price | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| All-Time High | $99.58 | Jan 16, 2026 -- Morgan Stanley upgrade day |
| Resistance Zone | $80-100 | Psychological barrier; options heavy zone |
| Current Price | ~$70.86 | Post-pullback from ATH |
| 200-Day MA | ~$59.90 | Key long-term trend support |
| 50-Day MA | ~$80.40 | Currently above 200-DMA (golden cross intact) |
| Major Support | $50-55 | Previous breakout level; high-volume node |
| SPAC IPO Price | ~$10 | August 2021 entry; ~609% return to current |

## 2. Comparable Company Analysis

Rocket Lab occupies a unique position in public markets -- there is no perfect comparable. It is simultaneously a launch provider, satellite manufacturer, space component supplier, and aspiring defense prime. The comp set must be drawn from multiple categories.

### Primary Comp Table

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | Revenue (TTM) | P/S (TTM) | EV/Revenue | Revenue Growth | Profitable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rocket Lab** | RKLB | ~$38B | ~$595M (FY2025E) | ~64x | ~52x | 48% YoY (Q3) | No (improving) |
| **SpaceX** (private) | -- | $800B standalone (Dec 2025); ~$1.25T combined post-xAI merger (Feb 2026) | ~$15.5B (2025) | ~50x (standalone) | ~50x | ~30-40% | Yes |
| **Firefly Aerospace** | FLY | ~$3.2B | ~$61M (FY2024) | ~52x | ~20x | ~10% YoY (FY2024); FY2025E ~150%+ | No (-$231M loss FY2024) |
| **Intuitive Machines** | LUNR | ~$2.6-3.9B | ~$220M (FY2024) | ~10x | ~9x | 8% YoY (slowing) | No (-$193M loss) |
| **Palantir** | PLTR | ~$323B | ~$4.5B (FY2025, reported Feb 2 2026) | ~72x | ~70x | 56% YoY | Yes |
| **Anduril** (private) | -- | $79.6B (secondary) | ~$1B+ (2024) | ~80x | ~80x | 138% YoY (2024) | Not disclosed |
| **Lockheed Martin** | LMT | ~$151B | ~$75B (FY2025, reported Jan 29 2026) | ~2.0x | ~2.0x | 6% YoY | Yes |
| **Northrop Grumman** | NOC | ~$100B | ~$41B | ~2.4x | ~2.7x | Mid-single digits | Yes |
| **L3Harris** | LHX | ~$66.5B | ~$21.9B | ~3.0x | ~3.5x | ~6% | Yes |

### Premium/Discount Analysis by Comp Category

**vs. SpaceX (Private Market)**
SpaceX's standalone valuation reached ~$800B in December 2025 secondary trading (~50x sales on ~$15.5B revenue). On February 2, 2026, SpaceX merged with xAI, and the combined entity approaches ~$1.25T. The standalone SpaceX IPO target of $1.5T may have been superseded by this merger. Rocket Lab trades at a slight premium to SpaceX on a standalone P/S basis (~64x vs ~50x), which is unusual for a company 25x smaller by revenue. The justification: RKLB is the only liquid, publicly traded pure-play space stock at scale. A SpaceX/xAI IPO could re-rate the entire space sector higher, but could also drain capital from RKLB into the larger combined entity.

**vs. Firefly Aerospace (FLY)**
Rocket Lab commands a ~2x P/S premium over Firefly (~64x vs ~30x). This premium is justified by: (1) Electron's proven flight heritage (81 launches, 100% success in 2025), (2) a deeper space systems business ($1.1B backlog), (3) Neutron being further along than Firefly's Beta/Gamma vehicles, and (4) SDA prime contractor status. Firefly is earlier-stage with higher execution risk and smaller revenue base.

**vs. Intuitive Machines (LUNR)**
RKLB trades at a massive premium to LUNR (~64x vs ~9-18x P/S). Intuitive Machines has a narrower lunar-focused business, decelerating revenue growth (8% in Q3 vs 48% for RKLB), and higher mission-specific risk. LUNR's recent Lanteris acquisition ($800M) diversifies it but adds integration risk. Rocket Lab's premium reflects its broader TAM, stronger growth trajectory, and multi-segment revenue diversification.

**vs. Defense Primes (LMT, NOC, LHX)**
Traditional defense primes trade at 2.0-3.5x sales -- roughly 18-32x cheaper than RKLB on a P/S basis. These companies are mature, profitable, capital-return stories growing mid-single digits. The massive valuation gap reflects: (1) RKLB's growth rate is 10x higher, (2) RKLB is early-stage with optionality that primes lack, (3) the market treats RKLB as a tech/growth stock, not a defense contractor. However, Rocket Lab's Space Systems business increasingly competes directly with these primes' space segments (LMT Space does ~$13B in revenue; NOC Space Systems does ~$11.7B). If RKLB ever reaches defense-prime scale, the multiple should converge downward.

**vs. High-Growth Defense Tech (PLTR, Anduril)**
This is arguably the most relevant comp category. Palantir trades at ~72x 2025 sales ($4.5B revenue reported Feb 2, 2026) -- still richer than RKLB. Anduril's implied secondary-market multiple is ~80x revenue. These valuations reflect market belief in structural defense tech spend increases and winner-take-most dynamics. RKLB's ~64x P/S actually represents a discount to PLTR, suggesting the market assigns somewhat lower "platform premium" to RKLB versus pure software/AI defense plays.

## 3. Valuation Scenarios (Bull / Base / Bear)

### Bull Case: "The Next Aerospace Prime"

| Assumption | Detail |
|---|---|
| Neutron first flight | Mid-2026, operational by 2027 |
| NSSL contracts | Neutron wins Lane 1 missions starting 2027-2028 |
| SDA execution | On-time delivery of 36+ satellites; follow-on contracts |
| Electron cadence | 25-30 launches/year by 2028 |
| Space Systems | Backlog grows to $3B+ with constellation wins |
| Revenue (2028E) | $1.5-2.0B |
| Gross margin | 45%+ (non-GAAP) as Neutron scales |
| Adj. EBITDA | Positive by late 2026, expanding through 2028 |
| SpaceX IPO | Re-rates all space stocks 20-30% higher |
| Justified P/S (2028E) | 25-35x on $1.5B = $37-52B... or 20-25x on $2B = $40-50B |

**Bull Case Implied Market Cap: $50-70B ($95-$130/share)**

Key catalysts: Successful Neutron first flight, SpaceX IPO at $1.5T, additional SDA/Golden Dome contract wins, NSSL Lane 1 certification, international defense contracts, and sustained 50%+ revenue growth.

In this scenario, today's ~$38B market cap is actually reasonable -- the stock would appreciate 30-80% over 2-3 years as revenue catches up to the multiple. The P/S would naturally compress from ~64x to ~25-35x on much higher revenue, which is still a premium valuation but more sustainable.

### Base Case: "Delayed But Delivered"

| Assumption | Detail |
|---|---|
| Neutron first flight | Late 2026 or H1 2027 (12-18 month delay from original timeline) |
| NSSL contracts | Limited initially; needs flight heritage first |
| SDA execution | On-track but margins tighter than expected on fixed-price |
| Electron cadence | Stable at 20-22 launches/year |
| Space Systems | Backlog converts steadily; 1-2 new program wins |
| Revenue (2028E) | $1.0-1.2B |
| Gross margin | 38-42% (non-GAAP); fixed-price pressure offsets scale |
| Adj. EBITDA | Positive by 2027 but thin margins |
| Justified P/S (2028E) | 15-20x on $1.1B = $16.5-22B |

**Base Case Implied Market Cap: $22-30B ($42-$57/share)**

This scenario implies 20-40% downside from current levels. The stock is pricing in near-perfect execution, and "good but not great" still results in multiple compression. The base case is not bearish on the business -- Rocket Lab would still be a $1B+ revenue space company growing 30%+ -- but the current valuation already discounts this outcome.

### Bear Case: "Neutron Stumbles, Reality Bites"

| Assumption | Detail |
|---|---|
| Neutron | Major delays (2+ years) or fundamental redesign needed |
| NSSL | No contracts without flight heritage; competitors advance |
| SDA execution | Cost overruns on fixed-price contracts; margin erosion |
| Electron | SpaceX rideshare continues to pressure small launch economics |
| Space Systems | Backlog conversion slows; limited new wins |
| Revenue (2028E) | $700-900M |
| Cash burn | Elevated; potential dilutive equity raise needed |
| Justified P/S (2028E) | 5-10x on $800M = $4-8B |

**Bear Case Implied Market Cap: $5-10B ($10-$19/share)**

In the bear case, the stock could revisit its 52-week low area ($14.71) or even approach SPAC-era levels. This scenario requires multiple things to go wrong simultaneously, but the January 2026 tank rupture demonstrated that rocket development does not follow linear timelines. If Neutron fails and the space launch market remains SpaceX-dominated, RKLB becomes a solid but overvalued small launch and satellite company.

### Scenario Summary Table

| Scenario | Probability | 2028E Revenue | Implied P/S | Implied Market Cap | Implied Price | Upside/Downside |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bull** | 20-25% | $1.5-2.0B | 25-35x | $50-70B | $95-130 | +40% to +93% |
| **Base** | 50-55% | $1.0-1.2B | 15-20x | $22-30B | $42-57 | -37% to -16% |
| **Bear** | 20-25% | $700-900M | 5-10x | $5-10B | $10-19 | -85% to -72% |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Value: ~$45-55/share** -- suggesting the stock is 20-35% overvalued at current levels on a risk-adjusted basis, though the range of outcomes is extraordinarily wide.

## 4. Stock Performance & Technical Analysis

### Performance Since IPO

Rocket Lab went public via SPAC merger with Vector Acquisition Corporation on August 25, 2021. The journey has been volatile:

| Period | Price Range | Return | Key Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| SPAC IPO (Aug 2021) | ~$10 | -- | Baseline |
| Initial Pop (Sep 2021) | ~$18-21 | +100% | Space hype cycle |
| Bear Market Bottom (Dec 2022) | ~$3.50 | -65% from IPO | Rate hikes, growth crash |
| Recovery (2023) | $3.50-$7.00 | +100% from lows | Revenue growth inflection |
| Breakout (2024) | $7-$28 | +300% | SDA contracts, Neutron progress |
| Parabolic Run (2025) | $12-$99 | +174% calendar year | Record launches, $816M SDA win |
| Current (Feb 2026) | ~$67 | +574% from IPO | Post-ATH consolidation |

### 2025 Performance Breakdown
- Calendar year 2025 return: +174%
- 3-year return (from Feb 2023 lows): ~1,800%
- The stock's 2025 surge was driven by: 21 Electron launches with 100% success, SDA Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 contract wins ($1.3B combined), record quarterly revenues each quarter, NSSL Lane 1 selection, and Morgan Stanley upgrade to Overweight with $105 PT

### Technical Indicators (as of Feb 20, 2026)

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **RSI (14)** | ~50 | Neutral -- neither overbought nor oversold |
| **50-Day MA** | ~$80.40 | Stock trading below 50-DMA (bearish near-term) |
| **200-Day MA** | ~$59.90 | Stock trading above 200-DMA (bullish long-term trend) |
| **Golden Cross** | Intact | 50-DMA remains above 200-DMA |
| **MACD** | Bearish crossover | Near-term momentum fading |
| **Volume** | Declining from ATH levels | Consolidation pattern |

### Key Support/Resistance Levels

- **Immediate resistance:** $75-80 (50-DMA, previous support-turned-resistance)
- **Major resistance:** $99.58 (ATH)
- **Immediate support:** $60 (200-DMA proximity, round number)
- **Major support:** $50-55 (October 2025 breakout level, high-volume node)
- **Downside risk level:** $40 (pre-SDA Tranche 3 levels)
- **Extreme downside:** $14-15 (52-week low, SPAC-era support)

### Short Interest

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Shares Short | ~37.7M |
| Short Interest (% of Float) | ~7.1% |
| Recent Trend | Declining significantly (from 60.3M peak to ~37.7M as of Feb 2026) |
| Days to Cover | ~3 days |

Short interest has declined substantially from its late-2025 peak (~60M shares, ~14% of float) to ~37.7M shares (~7.1%) as of February 2026. Many bears have covered following the pullback from $99. At ~7% short interest, the stock is less susceptible to a short squeeze than during the late-2025 period, but any strong positive catalyst (Neutron success, earnings beat) could still pressure remaining shorts.

### Options Market Sentiment

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Put/Call OI Ratio | 0.72 | Mildly bullish (below 1.0) |
| Implied Volatility | Elevated | Earnings on Feb 26 driving premium |
| Heavy Strike Activity | $50P, $70P, $100C, $120C | Suggests market expects wide range |

## 5. Ownership Structure

### Top Shareholders

| Rank | Holder | Shares (M) | % Ownership | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Peter Beck** (CEO, via Series A Preferred + direct) | ~51M (beneficial)* | ~10% | Insider/Founder |
| 2 | **Bessemer Venture Partners VIII** | 57.0M | 10.7% | Venture Capital |
| 3 | **Vanguard Group** | ~42M | ~8% | Index/Passive |
| 4 | **BlackRock** | ~31-33M | ~6.2% | Index/Passive |
| 5 | **Baillie Gifford & Co** | est. 3-5% | -- | Active Growth |
| 6 | **UBS Group AG** | est. 2-3% | -- | Institutional |
| 7 | **Capital World Investors** | est. 2-3% | -- | Active Growth |
| 8 | **State Street Corp** | est. 2-3% | -- | Index/Passive |
| 9 | **Susquehanna Intl Group** | est. 1-2% | -- | Quantitative |
| 10 | **JPMorgan Chase** | est. 1-2% | -- | Institutional |

*Peter Beck converted 50,951,250 common shares into Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. As of Dec 2025, his direct common holdings are ~903K shares; his total beneficial ownership including preferred is approximately 10% per SEC filings. Equatorial Trust shares were fully sold by Dec 2025.

### Ownership Distribution

| Category | % of Shares | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Insiders** | ~31.9% | Peter Beck + other directors/officers |
| **Institutional** | ~50.4% | 1,059 institutional holders on record |
| **Retail** | ~17.7% | Significant retail following; active on social media |

Total institutional holders: 1,059 firms filing 13D/G or 13F forms, holding ~303M shares.

### Insider Transaction Activity (2025-2026)

Peter Beck's recent selling has been a recurring concern for some investors, though all sales have been conducted under pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plans:

| Date | Transaction | Shares | Estimated Proceeds | Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sep 15-16, 2025 | Sale (Equatorial Trust) | ~2.5M | ~$127.4M | 10b5-1 plan (adopted Jun 2025) |
| Nov 24, 2025 | Sale | ~19K | ~$766K | 10b5-1 plan |
| Dec 15-16, 2025 | Sale (Equatorial Trust) | 2,500,000 | ~$141M | 10b5-1 plan |
| Dec 2025 | Director sale | 5,000 | ~$350K | Board member |

Over the past 18 months, Beck has net sold ~5.0M shares. While the dollar amounts are large, they represent a small fraction of his total economic interest. Importantly, all sales occurred under pre-arranged plans filed months in advance, not discretionary market timing. Nonetheless, the optics of a CEO selling ~$270M in stock while the company is pre-profit and Neutron faces delays are worth noting.

Bessemer Venture Partners has also been gradually reducing its stake, declining from ~69.2M shares to ~57.0M shares (a ~17.6% reduction). As a venture fund with return-of-capital obligations to LPs, this is expected behavior for a position that has appreciated 5-10x since initial investment.

### Index Inclusion

| Index | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Russell 2000** | Graduated out (2025) | Market cap exceeded threshold |
| **Russell Midcap** | Added (June 2025) | Passive inflow from midcap funds |
| **Russell 1000** | Added (iShares Russell 1000 ETF) | Additional passive demand |
| **S&P 500** | Not yet eligible | Requires sustained GAAP profitability |

S&P 500 inclusion would be a significant catalyst (passive buying from trillions in indexed assets), but Rocket Lab must first demonstrate sustained GAAP profitability. This is unlikely before 2027-2028 at the earliest. Current S&P MidCap 400 eligibility is more realistic in the near term.

| **Seeking Alpha** | -- | Bearish analysis | Downgrade | Feb 2026 | "Even a Q4 beat won't save the stock"; valuation stretched |

### Key Analyst Debates

**The Bulls Argue:**
- Rocket Lab is becoming a defense prime contractor; SDA contracts are just the beginning
- Neutron unlocks a $10B+ TAM in medium-lift launch
- NSSL Lane 1 selection puts RKLB in elite company (SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin, Firefly)
- Golden Dome and proliferated LEO defense architecture are multi-decade tailwinds
- At Morgan Stanley's $105 target, RKLB would trade at ~30x forward 2027 revenue -- expensive but not unreasonable for 50%+ growth

**The Bears Argue:**
- At 60x+ trailing sales, the stock prices in 3-5 years of flawless execution
- Neutron has never flown; the January 2026 tank rupture is a red flag
- SDA fixed-price contracts carry significant margin risk for a company that has never built satellites at this scale
- SpaceX's Starship could make small and even medium-lift rockets economically obsolete
- Insider selling (Beck, Bessemer) signals those closest to the company are de-risking
- The stock has risen 1,800% in 3 years; mean reversion is overdue

### Consensus Revenue Estimates

| Year | Consensus Revenue | YoY Growth |
|---|---|---|
| FY2025E | ~$595-600M | +37% |
| FY2026E | ~$892M | +49-61% |
| FY2027E | ~$1.1-1.3B (est.) | +25-45% |
| FY2028E | ~$1.5B+ (limited coverage) | +15-30% |

## 7. Comprehensive Risk Matrix

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Neutron development delays** | HIGH | MEDIUM-HIGH | First flight pushed to 2027+; NSSL contracts delayed; narrative breaks | Next Stage 1 tank already in production; Peter Beck's execution track record on Electron |
| **Neutron tank rupture (Jan 2026)** | MEDIUM | ALREADY OCCURRED | Pushed timeline from mid-2026 to late 2026/2027; stock fell from ATH | Destructive test (intended to find limits); replacement tank in production |
| **SDA satellite delivery execution** | HIGH | MEDIUM | 36 satellites for DoD is unprecedented for RKLB; cost overruns on fixed-price | Subcontractors selected; leveraging existing Photon heritage; $1.1B backlog provides revenue visibility |
| **Manufacturing scale-up** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Hiring, facility buildout, supply chain for defense-scale production | New manufacturing facilities; Geost ($275M) and other acquisitions provide talent/capability |
| **Electron reliability at higher cadence** | LOW | LOW | 21 launches in 2025 with 100% success; any failure damages brand | Proven design with 81 launches; standardized production; two launch sites |

### Market & Competitive Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SpaceX Starship cost disruption** | HIGH | MEDIUM | If Starship achieves $2-10M per launch, it undercuts everything including Neutron | Neutron targets different segment (responsiveness, dedicated orbits, smaller payloads); Starship is overkill for many missions |
| **SpaceX rideshare pricing** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Already pressuring small launch economics; Electron must compete on service not price | Electron sells mission flexibility, dedicated orbit, schedule reliability -- not price |
| **Blue Origin New Glenn** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Another medium-lift competitor with deeper pockets (Bezos) | New Glenn is larger/more expensive; different market positioning; still early in flight heritage |
| **Chinese launcher competition** | LOW-MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Chinese commercial launchers offer low-cost alternatives for non-US customers | ITAR restrictions segment the market; US/allied customers can't use Chinese rockets |
| **Constellation demand cyclicality** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Satellite constellation deployments come in waves; gaps between deployment phases | Diversified across launch, space systems, and defense; SDA provides multi-year visibility |

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cash burn rate** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Neutron development + SDA ramp = elevated cash consumption; had >$1B cash at Q3 2025 | $1B+ cash position; convertible notes provide runway; backlog conversion generates operating cash |
| **Dilution from SBC** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Shares outstanding growing 3-6% annually; $355M convertible notes (4.25%, due 2029) add potential dilution at ~$5.13 conversion price | Conversion price deep in-the-money; company can settle in cash/stock mix at its election |
| **Need for additional capital** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | If Neutron costs exceed budget or SDA margins are thin, may need equity raise | Strong balance sheet today; government contracts provide cash flow visibility |
| **Fixed-price contract margin risk** | HIGH | MEDIUM | SDA contracts are firm-fixed-price; cost overruns come directly from Rocket Lab's margin | First-time satellite production at scale; limited margin of error; subcontractor cost management critical |
| **Currency risk (NZD)** | LOW | MEDIUM | Electron operations in New Zealand; NZD/USD fluctuations affect costs | Revenue primarily in USD; operational costs partially in NZD |

### Macro & Political Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Defense budget uncertainty** | MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM | Sequestration or budget cuts could slow SDA procurement | Bipartisan support for space defense; Golden Dome has strong administration backing |
| **Administration change risk** | MEDIUM | LOW | Golden Dome is Trump-era initiative; future administration could deprioritize | SDA/proliferated LEO is bipartisan; program has institutional momentum regardless of administration |
| **ITAR/export control changes** | LOW | LOW | Tighter controls could limit international business; looser controls could invite competition | RKLB benefits from current ITAR regime that segments market |
| **New Zealand political risk** | LOW | LOW | NZ political relationship with US could affect launch site operations | Rocket Lab has US headquarters and Virginia launch site; NZ operations are secondary |
| **FY26 defense bill** | POSITIVE | HIGH | Congress has unlocked billions for Golden Dome and restored SDA Tranche 3 funding | Direct tailwind for RKLB's satellite and launch business |

### Valuation-Specific Risks

This is the most critical risk category. Rocket Lab's current valuation prices in a future that must unfold almost perfectly.

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Multiple compression on execution stumble** | CRITICAL | MEDIUM | A Neutron delay combined with a revenue miss could send P/S from 60x to 20-30x -- a 50-70% drawdown |
| **Sentiment-driven volatility** | HIGH | HIGH | Stock has moved from $3.50 to $99.58 to $67 in 3 years; retail-heavy ownership amplifies swings |
| **SpaceX IPO paradox** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Could re-rate space stocks higher OR drain capital from RKLB into the "real" space leader |
| **Growth deceleration** | HIGH | MEDIUM | If revenue growth slows from 50%+ to 20-30%, the premium evaporates rapidly |
| **"What if everything goes right" is already priced** | HIGH | -- | This is the fundamental bear thesis: current market cap of ~$38B on ~$600M revenue requires flawless multi-year execution to justify |

### Stress Test: Neutron Delay + Revenue Miss

If Neutron is delayed to 2028 AND FY2026 revenue comes in at $750M (vs. $892M consensus), we estimate:
- P/S compresses to 15-25x (from ~64x) as the "Neutron premium" evaporates
- Implied market cap: $11-19B
- Implied share price: $21-36
- **Downside: 47-69% from current levels**

This is not the bear case -- this is a "moderate disappointment" scenario. The asymmetry of risk at current valuations is unfavorable: the upside from here requires near-perfection, while moderate disappointment implies severe drawdowns.

### Capital Structure Detail

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cash & Marketable Securities | >$1.0B | As of Q3 2025 |
| Total Financial Debt | ~$415M | Convertible notes ($347M net) + other borrowings ($51.3M) + current installments ($17.1M) |
| 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes | $355M | Due Feb 2029; conversion price ~$5.13/share (deep ITM) |
| Total Shareholder Equity | ~$431M | |
| Debt-to-Equity | ~96% | Elevated but manageable with cash position |
| Net Cash Position | ~$393M | Cash ($808M) exceeds total financial debt ($415M) |
| Backlog | $1.1B | 57% expected to convert within 12 months |

The balance sheet is healthy. Net cash positive, with $1B+ in liquidity. The convertible notes are deep in-the-money (conversion price $5.13 vs. $67 stock price), meaning they will almost certainly convert to equity, adding ~69M shares of dilution (~13% of current shares outstanding). This dilution is largely already reflected in fully diluted share counts.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Valuation is the primary risk.** Rocket Lab's business fundamentals are strong and improving. But at 60x+ trailing sales, the stock requires multi-year flawless execution to justify current levels. The probability-weighted expected value suggests 20-35% overvaluation.

2. **Neutron is binary.** Success validates the premium; delays or failure could trigger 50%+ drawdowns. The January 2026 tank rupture adds uncertainty to an already aggressive timeline.

3. **The comp set is favorable but misleading.** RKLB trades at a discount to PLTR and at parity with SpaceX, but those comps can justify any valuation. The more relevant comparison is what P/S ratio a $1B+ revenue space company should command -- historically, 15-25x for high-growth defense/space.

4. **Ownership quality is high.** Bessemer, Vanguard, BlackRock, and Baillie Gifford provide institutional credibility. Peter Beck's selling is routine 10b5-1 activity, not a red flag.

5. **The asymmetry favors patience.** For new investors, the risk/reward is better at $40-50 (200-DMA/prior breakout) than at $67. For existing holders, the long-term thesis remains intact, but position sizing should reflect the valuation risk. The Feb 26, 2026 earnings report (Q4 2025) and any Neutron timeline update will be the next major catalysts.
