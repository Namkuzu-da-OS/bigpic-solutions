## 1. Revenue History & Trajectory

### Annual Revenue

| Fiscal Year | Revenue ($M) | YoY Growth |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 2020        | ~$35        | --         |
| 2021        | $62.2       | ~77%       |
| 2022        | $211.0      | +239%      |
| 2023        | $244.6      | +16%       |
| 2024        | $436.2      | +78%       |
| 2025E       | ~$597-$602  | ~37-38%    |
| 2026E       | ~$892       | ~48-50%    |

**Note on FY2025:** Q1-Q3 2025 actual revenue totals $422.1M. With Q4 2025 guidance of $170-180M, FY2025 implied total is $592-$602M. Some consensus estimates run as high as $620M if Q4 outperforms the midpoint.

**Note on FY2026:** Consensus analyst estimates from 14 analysts project approximately $892M in revenue for FY2026, representing roughly 48-50% growth over FY2025.

**Revenue CAGR (2021-2025E):** Using $62.2M (2021) to ~$597M (2025E low-end) over 4 years yields a CAGR of approximately 76%. Even using the slower-growth 2023 year as context, the multi-year trajectory is exceptional for a hardware-intensive space company.

### Quarterly Revenue

| Quarter | Revenue ($M) | QoQ Change | YoY Change |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Q1 2021 | $18.2       | --         | --         |
| Q2 2021 | $11.3       | -38%       | --         |

| Q2 2025 | $144.5      | +18%       | +36%       |
| Q3 2025 | $155.1      | +7%        | +48%       |
| Q4 2025E| $170-180    | +10-16%    | +28-36%    |

**Key observations:**
- 2021 was highly lumpy as a pre-scale startup year. Revenue has become more consistent since 2022.
- 2023 showed a notable growth deceleration (16% annual) driven by slower launch cadence (10 missions vs. 9 in 2022) and the wind-down of some legacy Space Systems contracts.
- Growth re-accelerated sharply in 2024 (+78% annual) as the SDA Tranche 2 contract began flowing, launch cadence ramped to 16 missions, and new Space Systems contracts came online.
- The company has posted sequential quarterly revenue records in Q1, Q2, and Q3 2025, with Q4 2025 guided to be the largest quarter yet.

## 2. Revenue Segmentation

### Annual Segment Revenue

| Year | Launch Services ($M) | Space Systems ($M) | Total ($M) | Space Systems % |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------------:|
| 2021 | ~$38.5              | ~$23.7             | $62.2     | 38%              |
| 2022 | $60.7               | $150.3             | $211.0    | 71%              |
| 2023 | $71.9               | $172.7             | $244.6    | 71%              |
| 2024 | $125.4              | $310.8             | $436.2    | 71%              |
| 2025 (Q1-Q3) | ~$123.0     | ~$299.1            | $422.1    | 71%              |

**Note on 2021:** Rocket Lab's 2021 10-K shows a different composition than later years, with Launch Services representing approximately 62% of revenue. By 2022, the rapid build-out of the Space Systems segment via acquisitions (SolAero, PSC, ASI) flipped the revenue mix to 71% Space Systems -- a ratio that has remained remarkably stable through 2025.

### Quarterly Segment Revenue (2024-2025)

| Quarter | Launch Services ($M) | Space Systems ($M) | Total ($M) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------:|
| Q1 2024 | ~$29.0              | ~$63.8             | $92.8      |
| Q2 2024 | ~$33.4              | ~$72.9             | $106.3     |
| Q3 2024 | ~$20.5              | ~$84.3             | $104.8     |
| Q4 2024 | $42.4               | $90.0              | $132.4     |
| Q1 2025 | ~$35.6              | ~$87.0             | $122.6     |
| Q2 2025 | $46.7               | $97.9              | $144.5     |
| Q3 2025 | $40.9               | $114.2             | $155.1     |

**Which segment is growing faster?** Space Systems has consistently grown faster than Launch Services on an absolute dollar basis. In FY2024, Space Systems grew 80% YoY ($172.7M to $310.8M) vs. Launch Services at 74% ($71.9M to $125.4M). In 2025 through Q3, Space Systems continues to outpace due to SDA satellite manufacturing revenue recognition, the Globalstar/MDA spacecraft program, and the Geost acquisition (closed Q3 2025 for $275M base + up to $50M earnout).

### Revenue Per Electron Launch

| Year | Launches | Launch Revenue ($M) | Avg. Revenue/Launch ($M) |
|------|----------|--------------------:|-------------------------:|
| 2021 | 6        | ~$38.5              | ~$6.4                    |
| 2022 | 9        | $60.7               | ~$6.7                    |
| 2023 | 10       | $71.9               | ~$7.2                    |
| 2024 | 16       | $125.4              | ~$7.8                    |
| 2025 (Q3) | --  | --                  | ~$10.0+ (Q3 alone)       |

Average selling price per Electron launch has risen from ~$5.8M at debut to over $10M in Q3 2025 -- a 67%+ increase demonstrating meaningful pricing power as the rocket matures and demand for dedicated small-sat launches grows. New contracts signed in Q3 2024 averaged $8.4M per launch.

### SDA Contract Revenue Recognition

Rocket Lab holds two major SDA (Space Development Agency) contracts:

1. **SDA Tranche 2 Transport Layer Beta:** $515M contract for 18 satellites. Revenue recognition began in FY2024 and is flowing through the Space Systems segment as satellite manufacturing progresses. Delivery timelines are through 2027.
2. **SDA Tranche 3 Tracking Layer:** $816M contract for 18 MWTD (Missile Warning, Tracking, and Defense) satellites, awarded December 2025. Launches targeted for FY2029. Revenue recognition will begin as milestones are achieved in spacecraft manufacturing, likely starting in FY2026-2027.

Combined SDA contract value: >$1.3B. These are firm fixed-price OTA agreements, providing revenue visibility extending to 2029.

### Backlog

| Date | Total Backlog ($M) | Launch Backlog ($M) | Space Systems Backlog ($M) |
|------|--------------------|--------------------:|---------------------------:|
| End of 2023 | ~$1,046        | $248                | $798                       |
| Q2 2024     | $1,070         | $294                | $773                       |
| Q3 2024     | $1,050         | --                  | --                         |
| End of 2024 | $1,067         | $386                | $681                       |
| Q2 2025     | ~$1,000        | --                  | --                         |
| Q3 2025     | $1,100+        | --                  | --                         |

Backlog has held above $1B since late 2023. The Q3 2025 backlog exceeds $1.1B before the $816M SDA Tranche 3 contract (awarded December 2025, likely to appear in Q4 2025 or Q1 2026 backlog). Including that award, effective backlog approaches $2B, representing roughly 3 years of revenue at FY2025 run rates.

## 3. Profitability Metrics

### Gross Margin Trajectory

| Quarter | Revenue ($M) | Gross Profit ($M) | GAAP GM (%) | Non-GAAP GM (%) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Q1 2023 | $54.9       | ~$6.4             | ~11.6%      | --              |
| Q2 2023 | $62.0       | ~$14.6            | ~23.5%      | --              |
| Q3 2023 | $67.7       | ~$15.0            | ~22.1%      | --              |
| Q4 2023 | $60.0       | ~$15.5            | ~25.8%      | --              |
| FY 2023 | $244.6      | ~$51.0            | ~21%        | ~26%            |
| Q1 2024 | $92.8       | $24.2             | 26.0%       | ~30%            |
| Q2 2024 | $106.3      | $27.2             | 25.6%       | 30.7%           |
| Q3 2024 | $104.8      | ~$28.0            | ~27%        | ~31%            |
| Q4 2024 | $132.4      | $36.8             | 27.8%       | ~32%            |
| FY 2024 | $436.2      | $116.2            | 26.6%       | ~31%            |
| Q1 2025 | $122.6      | $35.3             | 28.8%       | ~33%            |
| Q2 2025 | $144.5      | $46.4             | 32.1%       | 36.9%           |
| Q3 2025 | $155.1      | $57.3             | **37.0%**   | **41.9%**       |

**Q3 2025 was a record on both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin.** The trajectory shows a clear and accelerating margin expansion -- from roughly 21% GAAP in FY2023 to 37% GAAP in Q3 2025. This improvement reflects:

- Higher-margin Space Systems contracts replacing legacy low-margin work (SolAero's legacy contracts are phased out)
- Increasing Electron pricing power with higher cadence
- Scale benefits from higher volumes in both segments
- Geost acquisition contributing higher-margin defense systems revenue

**Q4 2025 guidance:** GAAP gross margin 37-39%; non-GAAP gross margin 43-45%.

### Operating Margin / EBITDA

| Quarter | Operating Loss ($M) | Op. Margin | Adj. EBITDA ($M) | EBITDA Margin |
|---------|--------------------:|-----------:|-----------------:|--------------:|
| Q4 2024 | ($51.6)             | -39%       | ($23.2)          | -18%          |
| Q1 2025 | ($59.2)             | -48%       | ($31.2)          | -25%          |
| Q2 2025 | ($59.6)             | -41%       | ($26.3)          | -18%          |
| Q3 2025 | ($59.0)             | -38%       | ($26.3)          | -17%          |

Operating losses have been roughly flat at ~$59M/quarter through 2025 despite revenue growing 26% over the same period (Q1 to Q3 2025). This demonstrates improving operating leverage -- the incremental revenue is dropping through at a much higher rate than historical norms.

**Q4 2025 Adj. EBITDA guidance:** Loss of ($23M)-($29M).

### Net Income / Loss

| Period | Net Loss ($M) | EPS (Basic) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| FY 2021 | ~($117)      | --          |
| FY 2022 | ~($135)      | ($0.29)     |
| FY 2023 | ~($183)      | ($0.38)     |
| FY 2024 | ~($190)      | ($0.38)     |
| Q1 2025 | ($60.6)      | ($0.12)     |
| Q2 2025 | ($66.4)      | ($0.13)     |
| Q3 2025 | ($18.3)      | ($0.03)     |
| 9M 2025 | ($145.3)     | ($0.28)     |

The Q3 2025 net loss of ($18.3M) was a significant improvement vs. Q2's ($66.4M), driven partly by the record gross margin and partly by favorable items below the operating line (interest income on higher cash balances, lower non-cash charges). The TTM (trailing twelve months) net loss as of Q3 2025 was approximately ($187M).

**Annual EPS has been flat at ($0.38) for both 2023 and 2024,** despite revenue nearly doubling, indicating that expense growth has tracked revenue growth but not outpaced it.

### Stock-Based Compensation

| Period | SBC ($M) | SBC as % of Revenue |
|--------|---------|--------------------:|
| FY 2022 | $55.0   | 26%                 |
| FY 2023 | $53.0   | 22%                 |
| FY 2024 | $57.0   | 13%                 |
| Q1 2025 | ~$17.0  | 14%                 |
| Q2 2025 | ~$20.0  | 14%                 |
| Q3 2025 | $15.7   | 10%                 |
| 9M 2025 | $52.9   | 13%                 |

SBC as a percentage of revenue is declining meaningfully -- from 26% in 2022 to 10% in Q3 2025 -- as revenue scales faster than equity compensation. However, absolute SBC dollars remain material at a ~$70M annualized run rate based on 9M 2025 figures.

### Consensus GAAP Profitability Timeline

Analysts generally project:
- **Adjusted EBITDA breakeven:** Late FY2026 / early FY2027
- **Positive free cash flow:** FY2027
- **GAAP net income positive:** FY2027 or FY2028

The FY2026 consensus EPS estimate is approximately ($0.20), representing a 45% improvement from FY2025 levels.

## 4. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet

### Operating Cash Flow (Quarterly)

| Quarter | Operating Cash Flow ($M) |
|---------|------------------------:|
| Q1 2023 | ($25.4)                  |
| Q2 2023 | ($6.1)                   |
| Q3 2023 | ($25.2)                  |
| Q4 2023 | ($42.2)                  |
| FY 2023 | ($98.9)                  |
| Q1 2024 | ($2.6)                   |
| Q2 2024 | ($13.0)                  |
| Q3 2024 | ($30.9)                  |
| Q4 2024 | ($2.4)                   |
| FY 2024 | ($48.9)                  |
| Q1 2025 | ($54.2)                  |
| Q2 2025 | ($23.2)                  |
| Q3 2025 | ($23.5)                  |
| 9M 2025 | ($101.0)                 |

FY2024 OCF of ($48.9M) was a meaningful improvement vs. FY2023's ($98.9M), driven by higher revenue and improved margins. The 9M 2025 figure of ($101.0M) is elevated due to a particularly heavy Q1 2025 (working capital swings, Geost deal preparation).

### Free Cash Flow

| Period | OCF ($M) | CapEx ($M) | FCF ($M) |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| FY 2023 | ($98.9) | ~($54.7)  | ~($153.6) |
| FY 2024 | ($48.9) | ~($67.1)  | ~($116.0) |
| Q1 2025 | ($54.2) | ($28.7)   | ($82.9) |
| Q2 2025 | ($23.2) | ($32.0)   | ($55.3) |
| Q3 2025 | ($23.5) | ($45.9)   | ($69.4) |
| 9M 2025 | ($101.0)| ($106.6)  | ($207.6)|

Free cash flow remains deeply negative, primarily driven by elevated capital expenditures for Neutron development, Launch Complex 3 construction in Virginia, and engine test facilities. CapEx has ramped from ~$55M in FY2023 to ~$67M in FY2024 to an annualized ~$142M run rate in 2025.

| Q3 2025 | $807.9               | $415.4*         | $392.5               | $2,221.4           | $1,281.0                  |

*Total financial debt: convertible notes ($347M net) + long-term borrowings ($51.3M) + current installments ($17.1M) = $415.4M. Excludes lease liabilities.

### Debt Structure

Rocket Lab's debt consists primarily of:

1. **Convertible Senior Notes:** $347M outstanding (originally $355M issued February 2024)
   - Interest rate: 4.25% per annum, semi-annual payments
   - Maturity: February 1, 2029
   - Conversion price: ~$5.13/share (initial); effective conversion price ~$8.04/share after capped call transactions
   - Redeemable by RKLB on/after February 1, 2027 if stock exceeds 130% of conversion price for a specified period
   - With RKLB trading well above $8.04, these notes will almost certainly convert to equity (dilutive but eliminates the debt)
2. **Other long-term debt:** ~$51.3M (equipment financing, facility loans)
3. **Other borrowings:** Remaining balance of ~$118M (likely related to the Geost acquisition financing)

### Capital Raises

- **February 2024:** Closed $355M convertible senior notes offering. Net proceeds of ~$300M after capped call costs ($43.2M) and underwriting ($11.5M). Used ~$40M to repay equipment financing.
- **September 2025:** Entered into ATM (at-the-market) equity offering program for up to $750M. At the ~$38B market cap at time of announcement, full utilization would dilute shareholders by approximately 3%.
- **Q3 2025:** Raised approximately $458M through common stock issuance (a mix of ATM sales and the Geost acquisition equity component).

### Cash Burn Runway

As of Q3 2025, Rocket Lab holds $807.9M in cash with quarterly cash burn (FCF) averaging roughly ($69M)/quarter in the most recent quarters. At that rate, the company has approximately **11-12 quarters (~3 years) of runway** before needing additional capital, not accounting for further ATM utilization, backlog conversion improvements, or potential margin expansion reducing the burn.

Additionally, total liquidity exceeds $1B including available credit facilities.

### Shares Outstanding

| Date | Shares Outstanding (M) |
|------|----------------------:|
| End of 2023 | ~482                 |
| End of 2024 | ~498                 |
| Q3 2025     | ~529 (weighted avg basic); ~534M as of Feb 2026 |

Dilution has been moderate -- approximately 11.6% share count increase over ~2 years. If convertible notes fully convert, an additional ~69M shares would be added (at the $5.13 conversion price), bringing the total to ~598M shares. However, the capped call structure limits dilution impact until the stock exceeds $8.04.

## 5. Earnings History & Analyst Expectations

### Earnings Beat/Miss Track Record

| Quarter | EPS Actual | EPS Estimate | Surprise | Revenue Actual ($M) | Rev. Estimate ($M) | Rev. Surprise |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------------:|
| Q1 2024 | ($0.09)   | ($0.09)     | In-line  | $92.8               | ~$91.4              | Beat          |
| Q2 2024 | ($0.08)   | ($0.09)     | Beat     | $106.3              | ~$106.0             | Beat          |
| Q3 2024 | ($0.10)   | ($0.10)     | In-line  | $104.8              | ~$105.0             | In-line       |
| Q4 2024 | ($0.10)   | ($0.09)     | Miss     | $132.4              | ~$130.0             | Beat          |
| Q1 2025 | ($0.12)   | ($0.10)     | Miss     | $122.6              | ~$121.4             | Beat          |
| Q2 2025 | ($0.13)   | ($0.10)     | Miss     | $144.5              | ~$137.0             | Beat          |
| Q3 2025 | **($0.03)**| ($0.10)     | **Beat** | **$155.1**          | ~$151.0             | **Beat**      |

**Key pattern:** Rocket Lab has consistently beaten revenue estimates while missing or meeting EPS estimates. The revenue beats reflect management's tendency to guide conservatively. The EPS misses are largely driven by non-cash items and elevated R&D spending for Neutron. The Q3 2025 quarter was a breakout -- a massive EPS beat of 70% (($0.03) vs. ($0.10) estimate) alongside a revenue beat.

### Q4 2025 / FY2025 Consensus

| Metric | Q4 2025 Consensus | FY2025 Consensus |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Revenue | $170-180M (guidance) | ~$597-620M |
| GAAP Gross Margin | 37-39% (guidance) | ~33% |
| EPS | ($0.10) | ~($0.37) |
| Adj. EBITDA | ($23M)-($29M) (guidance) | ~($107M) |

**Q4 2025 results are scheduled for February 26, 2026.**

### FY2026 Consensus Estimates

| Metric | FY2026 Consensus |
|--------|-----------------|
| Revenue | ~$892M |
| Revenue Growth | ~48-50% YoY |
| EPS | ~($0.20) |
| Gross Margin | ~38-42% |

### Analyst Price Targets & Ratings (as of February 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Consensus Rating | Buy (11 analysts) |
| % Strong Buy / Buy | 81% |
| % Hold | 18% |
| % Sell | 0% |
| Average Price Target | ~$66 |
| Median Price Target | ~$83 |
| Low Target | $55 |
| High Target | $120 |

Notable recent activity: Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $105 in January 2026. The wide spread between average and median targets reflects a few legacy lower targets that have not been updated.

## 6. Path to Profitability

### What Needs to Happen

Rocket Lab's path to breakeven requires four converging drivers:

**1. Space Systems margin maturation**
- Space Systems GAAP gross margins have expanded from the low-teens in early 2023 to the upper-20s/low-30s in 2025, with the target of low-40% gross margins.
- Legacy low-margin contracts (particularly inherited SolAero work) are being phased out and replaced with new contracts priced at 30%+ margins.
- The $1.3B in SDA contracts are firm fixed-price, providing manufacturing efficiencies at scale. As Rocket Lab moves through learning curves on satellite production, margins should expand.
- The Geost acquisition brings higher-margin defense technology (sensors, payloads) that could accrete to segment margins.

**2. Launch cadence and Electron pricing**
- Electron average selling price has risen from ~$6.4M/launch in 2021 to ~$10M+ in Q3 2025.
- Management targets 50%+ gross margins for Launch Services once cadence reaches 20+ launches/year consistently. In Q3 2025, launch margins were compressed by customer delays reducing cadence in the quarter, but the structural trajectory is toward 40-50% margins.
- A 20-launch year at $10M/launch = $200M in launch revenue. At 50% gross margin, that is $100M in gross profit from launch alone.

**3. Neutron changing unit economics**
- Neutron (medium-lift, reusable) is targeting ~13 tons to LEO -- competing with Falcon 9 and next-gen medium launchers.
- Cumulative Neutron development spend through end of 2025: ~$360M (up from $250-300M original estimate). The labor cost runs ~$15M/quarter.
- If Neutron reaches commercial operations, estimated pricing of $50-55M/launch vs. Falcon 9's ~$67M (for comparable payloads) could open a massive new TAM.
- Even at early operations, each Neutron launch could generate more revenue than a full quarter of Electron launches.
- First flight now targeted for mid-to-late 2026 following the January 2026 tank rupture, with commercial service likely in FY2027.

**4. Operating leverage on fixed costs**
- Operating expenses (excluding COGS) have been roughly flat at ~$95-100M/quarter through 2025 while revenue has grown 48% YoY.
- Management notes the company is approaching peak R&D spending on Neutron. Once Neutron development costs roll off, the operating cost structure should begin to lever down.
- SBC declining as a percentage of revenue (from 26% to 10%) reduces the non-GAAP-to-GAAP reconciliation gap.

### Profitability Timeline

| Milestone | Estimated Timeline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Adj. EBITDA approaching breakeven | Late FY2026 |
| Adj. EBITDA positive (sustained) | FY2027 |
| Positive free cash flow | FY2027 |
| GAAP net income positive | FY2027-2028 |

### SDA Contract Margins vs. Launch Margins

SDA satellite manufacturing contracts are firm fixed-price, which provides cost certainty but also means margins depend on execution discipline. Early production runs tend to carry lower margins (20-25%) as the company works through engineering challenges and supply chain setup. As production matures for the 18-unit runs, margins should converge toward the 30-40% range typical for defense satellite manufacturing.

Launch Services, by contrast, has inherent operating leverage -- the incremental cost of each additional Electron launch is relatively low once the manufacturing cadence is established. At scale (20+ launches/year), management targets 50%+ gross margins for launch, making it the higher-margin segment on a per-unit basis.

## 7. Comparison to Peers

### Revenue Scale

| Company | FY2024 Revenue ($M) | FY2025E Revenue ($M) | Market Cap ($B, ~Feb 2026) |
|---------|--------------------:|---------------------:|---------------------------:|
| **Rocket Lab (RKLB)** | **$436** | **~$600** | **~$36-39** |
| Firefly Aerospace (FLY) | $61 | ~$150-158 | ~$4.1 |
| Intuitive Machines (LUNR) | $228 | ~$225 | ~$3.5-3.9 |

Rocket Lab is the clear revenue leader among pure-play publicly traded space companies (excluding SpaceX, which is private). It generates roughly 3x Intuitive Machines' revenue and 7x Firefly's FY2024 revenue.

### Growth Rates

| Company | FY2024 YoY Growth | FY2025E YoY Growth |
|---------|------------------:|-----------:|
| **RKLB** | **+78%** | **~37-38%** |
| FLY | +10% | ~147-160% |
| LUNR | +187% | ~0% (flat) |

Firefly is in hyper-growth mode off a tiny base following its 2025 IPO and SciTech acquisition. LUNR's growth stalled as it transitions between lunar mission phases. RKLB offers the best combination of scale and growth.

### Margin Comparison

| Company | GAAP Gross Margin (Most Recent) | Operating Margin | Net Margin |
|---------|-------------------------------:|-----------------:|-----------:|
| **RKLB** | **37% (Q3 2025)** | **-38%** | **-12%** |
| FLY | -5% (TTM) | Deep negative | Deep negative |
| LUNR | ~11% (Q3 2025) | Negative | Negative |

Rocket Lab's gross margin profile is substantially ahead of peers. None of these companies are profitable, but RKLB is closest to breakeven on both an operating and net basis.

### Valuation Multiples

| Company | P/S (TTM) | EV/Rev (NTM) | EV/Rev (FY2026E) |
|---------|-------:|:------------|:-----------------|
| **RKLB** | **~67x** | ~42x | ~40-43x |
| FLY | ~37x | ~27x | ~15-20x |
| LUNR | ~10x | ~9x | ~8-12x |

RKLB trades at a significant premium to peers on revenue multiples. This premium reflects:
- Largest revenue base with consistent high growth
- Best margin profile and clearest path to profitability
- Most diversified business (launch + space systems + upcoming medium-lift)
- Strongest backlog ($1.1B+, approaching $2B with SDA Tranche 3)
- National security positioning (one of only 5 NSSL-eligible launch providers)

The premium is expensive by any traditional metric -- RKLB's P/S of ~67x is ranked worse than 97.8% of Aerospace & Defense companies (industry median: 3.6x). The valuation embeds significant expectations for Neutron success, SDA contract execution, and continued hypergrowth. Whether this is justified is a question for Report 04 (Valuation).

For reference, defense primes' space segments trade at far lower multiples but are embedded in larger enterprises:
- Northrop Grumman Space Systems: ~$11.7B revenue (FY2024), ~2.4x P/S on parent company
- L3Harris Space & Airborne: ~$6B revenue, ~2.5x P/S on parent company

These are not direct comparisons -- the primes are mature, lower-growth businesses -- but they illustrate the magnitude of the growth premium embedded in RKLB's valuation.

---

## Key Financial Takeaways

1. **Revenue momentum is strong.** 48% YoY growth in Q3 2025, with Q4 guided to $170-180M. FY2026 consensus of ~$892M implies continued acceleration.
2. **Margin expansion is the story.** GAAP gross margins went from ~21% (FY2023) to 37% (Q3 2025). If Q4 guidance of 37-39% holds, full-year 2025 GAAP gross margin will be ~33%, a significant expansion from 2023.
3. **The company is still burning cash.** 9M 2025 FCF is ($207.6M), primarily driven by Neutron CapEx. But with $808M cash on hand and $1B+ liquidity, runway extends 3+ years.
4. **Backlog provides visibility.** $1.1B+ backlog (pre-SDA Tranche 3) provides ~2 years of revenue visibility. Including Tranche 3, the figure approaches $2B.
5. **Profitability is approaching but not imminent.** Adjusted EBITDA breakeven is targeted for late 2026, with GAAP profitability likely in 2027-2028.
6. **Valuation is extreme.** At ~67x trailing P/S and ~42x forward EV/Revenue, RKLB is priced for near-flawless execution on Neutron, SDA contracts, and continued 40-50% annual growth.
