## Triple Witching + S&P Rebalancing

Triple Witch (stock index futures, index options, and single stock options expire simultaneously) occurs on the 3rd Friday of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec — the same day as S&P 500 quarterly rebalancing. Combined, these events move $5-6.5T in notional value.

**Strategy**: Long Monday open of witching week → exit Thursday close. Avoid witching Friday (14% win rate since 2021). Avoid the witching hour (3-4 PM, 31% win rate). Expect weakness in the following week.

| Expiration Date | T-9 (Positioning Starts) | T-3 to T-1 (Strongest Edge) | Week After (Bearish) |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Mar 20** | Mar 9 (Mon) | Mar 17-19 (Tue-Thu) | Mar 23-27 |
| **Jun 19** | Jun 8 (Mon) | Jun 16-18 (Tue-Thu) | Jun 22-26 |
| **Sep 18** | Sep 7 (Mon) | Sep 15-17 (Tue-Thu) | Sep 21-25 |
| **Dec 18** | Dec 7 (Mon) | Dec 15-17 (Tue-Thu) | Dec 21-24 |

**Key stats**: Pre-expiration rally averages +0.82% (T-9 to T-1). T-3 to T-1 averages +0.47% (134.59% annualized). Sep post-witch week is historically the worst.

## AAPL Buyback Blackout Windows

Corporate buyback blackout begins 35 calendar days before earnings and lifts after the report. During blackout, the corporate bid is removed — creating structural weakness early/mid phase and recovery late phase.

**Strategy**: Verified +12.13% return on Jan 2026 AAPL cycle. See `Strategies/Buyback-Blackout-Earnings-Flow-Strategy.md`.

| Quarter | Expected Earnings | Blackout Start (~35 days prior) | Seasonality |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Q2 FY26 | ~Apr 30 | ~Mar 26 | Weak (April seasonality) |
| Q3 FY26 | ~Jul 30 | ~Jun 25 | **Strongest** (+3.46% historical) |
| Q4 FY26 | ~Oct 29 | ~Sep 24 | Moderate |
| Q1 FY27 | ~Jan 28 | ~Dec 24 | Moderate-Strong |

*Earnings dates are estimates based on AAPL's historical pattern. Confirm via earnings calendar closer to each date.*

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Annual reconstitution (June) | **Jun 26** (4th Friday) | Full membership review. Historically generates ~$100B in rebalancing flows. |
